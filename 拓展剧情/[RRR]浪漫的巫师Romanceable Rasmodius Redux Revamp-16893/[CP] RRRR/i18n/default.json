	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Mon8_2.2": "I wish I knew how to approach her to get to know her better.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Mon8_2.3": "...We probably shouldn't discuss it, @. Sorry for bringing it up.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Tue8.1": "I've travelled all over, looking for secrets of the energies. I've had grand adventures, and suffered terrible tragedies.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Tue8.2": "When you have a drive and a passion, that is an energy that cannot be destroyed.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Wed8_1.1": "I will tell you of one place that I have been to.#$b#Once, while lost in a forest, I found a cabin and took shelter in it.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Wed8_1.2": "It was larger than it appeared on the inside, and it seemed to go on for miles.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Wed8_1.3": "At the end, I found a bed, and in it, a child. Its eyes were open, and it rose to stare at me.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Wed8_1.4": "It pointed at me, and I awoke in my bed at the inn. Very strange, and I still wonder about it.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Wed8_2.1": "You know, I felt you were special from the first time we met.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Wed8_2.2": "And I have to admit, I found it quite charming when you took that whiff from my cauldron and went so green I thought you were going to turn into a frog.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Thu8.1": "Walking the libraries of the world, even if you cannot understand the language, is an inspiring feeling. The energy one gains by being near books is great.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Thu8.2": "I used to spend hours in them, absorbing it all. Many are now gone, and it is a shame.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Fri8.1": "In my youth, the libraries would be brimming with life. Every page a portal, recorded down by scribes long past.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Fri8.2": "Some were full of secrets no one should know, and I took to them immediately. I regret it still.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Sat8.1": "The world I once knew is long gone. I hold on to fragments of it, but I am old. Someday, it will all be forgotten.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Sat8.2": "I'd like to tell you about it, @, to do so pull you into the maelstrom. As is the way.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Sun8.1": "I wish I could go back to the days of my youth for one more day. Go into the shop I always put off, talk to the librarians, learn even more.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Sun8.2": "Those days are long gone, and all I have left of them is a shadow. Such is life.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Mon10.1": "It has been a long time since I've had a relationship as close as this one.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Mon10.2": "I hope I am proving a good friend to you, @.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Mon10.3": "I would not want you to feel as if your efforts were wasted.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Tue10_1.1": "I am glad to see you, @.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Tue10_1.2": "I had predicted we would become friends, but I never imagined the extent of it.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Tue10_2.1": "You know, despite living outside the town, I enjoy catching glimpses of the lives of those in this valley.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Tue10_2.2": "It is always an interesting sight even if I never plan to participate.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Wed10.1": "Many people are scared of me. The unknown causes them to tremble, and my association with it frightens them.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Wed10.2": "You have continued to show you don't mind the mysterious.#$b#Thank you, @.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Thu10.1": "The energies, at their core, are chaotic. Ever changing, they are denser than air yet more elusive than wind.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Thu10.2": "In the end, many people believed it was not worth trying to solve the mystery, yet here I remain.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Thu10.3": "Someday, @, I will truly understand.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Fri10.1": "I feel renewed this year. Perhaps it is because I have finally found a good friend to share my time with.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Fri10.2": "Thank you for coming to visit me, @.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Sat10.1": "There are days I wish for more, but part of life is accepting compromise.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Sat10.2": "Having excess greed for things one should not have are common preludes to tragedy.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Sat10.3": "We would do well to remember that.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Sat10.4": "...I am no different.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Sun10.1": "The greatest energies are the ones we allow ourselves to find. Everything else is false.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Spring_Sun10.2": "Be true to what moves you, and you will be energized the rest of your life.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_1.1": "Summer has come at last. The energies are at their most powerful. I'll get a lot of work done this season.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_1.2": "Stay cool, @, and do not let the sun curse you.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_1.3": "Maybe I'll go swimming this time...",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Mon.1": "The many eared crop, its leaves capture the sun's energy itself, painting it all over.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Mon.2": "Amazing in its uses, its true desire is to feed people. An inspiring crop indeed.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Tue.1": "The bush with eyes of blue, it can see many things. Its power is in healing, and as such, is quite potent indeed.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Tue.2": "People crave them, but they are hard to find most of the year, and only good fresh. A crop whose quality is fleeting, very mysterious.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Wed.1": "Melon of the Earth, Melon of the Sky, Melon of the People, Melon of the Eye.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Wed.2": "Melon of the Mother, Melon of the Father, Melon of the Son, Melon of the Daughter.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Wed.3": "That concludes my shopping list.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Thu.1": "It is now that the crops that can make energy are born, and it is up to people like yourself to harness it.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Thu.2": "There are two crops available, and one has its seeds. To utilize them is pure alchemy.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Fri.1": "A powerful plant, it can induce dreams in those who drink it. Its powers many, its flavors are endless.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Fri.2": "Yet, it has brought ruin to civilizations, and is no friend of men or women. What is its true purpose?",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sat.1": "A powerful plant, it can induce dreams in those who drink it. Its powers many, its flavors are endless.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sat.2": "Yet, it has brought ruin to civilizations, and is no friend of men or women. What is its true purpose?",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sun.1": "The red crop, vegetable to some and fruit to others, has no keeper. It is delicious raw, cooked, or squeezed.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sun.2": "Many people like it, and some can't live without it. No home should lack its presence.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Mon2.1": "Long ago, there was a language that allowed people to converse with the spirits of the sun. They held many festivals during summer.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Mon2.2": "That culture is long gone, and the language of the sun lost to time. If only I could find a way...",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Tue2.1": "The energy during summer allows for easier methods of the mysterious. It is very addicting trying out new theories after two seasons of wondering.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Tue2.2": "Can you feel the energies? Do not worry if you cannot.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Wed2.1": "It was said that only the most powerful could learn and write the Sun Language, for it could burn those who wrote it.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Wed2.2": "It is rumored that there was a rival tribe that wrote in a special moon rune, but there has been no proof of such a language ever existing.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Thu2.1": "One of my experiments went well today. I was able to glance at the future for a moment.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Thu2.2": "All the voices, all of the emotions. It is going to be interesting.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Fri2.1": "I am very fortunate to have found just one letter of the Sun Language, which I keep hidden away. It burns crimson, constantly and forever.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Fri2.2": "It is the letter for 'hope.' Strange, isn't it? Someday I might be able to show you, but not now.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sat2.1": "Tomorrow I will be focusing my energy, and doing an experiment that could go very well, or very badly. If you see me, I will be in a trance.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sat2.2": "If it works, then you'll wake up and everything will be fine. If it doesn't, well, I did try.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sun2.1": "Hakata Monno ba, hakata bal bala. Shamlao 'tswal, catakan grana.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sun2.2": "Must...focus...must not...give in...",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Mon4_1.1": "If you've yet to use the Shrine of Illusion, then I must tell you to be cautious. Its history is vast, and much of it, bloody.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Mon4_1.2": "Use it with wisdom and all shall be fine.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Mon4_2.1": "I wish I could go into town to get seeds for my garden, but going into Pierre's store is a little awkward for me.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Mon4_2.2": "And that Joja monstrosity isn't even worth mentioning.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Tue4.1": "The previous owner of the Shrine of Illusion was a vain man, trying to find the perfect look for himself. He was wealthy, and won the shrine in a contest.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Tue4.2": "He invested all his wealth into it, trying to find the perfect look, but he was never happy.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Tue4.3": "He was trying to fix what was on the outside and not the inside, and it consumed him.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Wed4_1.1": "I found a warning in an old book regarding the Shrine of Illusion. It went as follows:",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Wed4_1.2": "'Only those who wish to find their true self are permitted to use the Shrine. Those who wish to change their appearance to trick others shall be cursed.'",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Wed4_1.3": "I've spent a long time trying to find what the curse is, but only have theories.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Wed4_2.1": "How goes your interactions with the Junimos, @?",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Wed4_2.2": "I've encountered many in my long years. They're certainly a strange sort.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Thu4_1.1": "My guesses for the Curse of the Shrine of Illusion are that if you use it for your own gain, and not to reveal your true self, your time on this mortal plane is cut short.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Thu4_1.2": "Many have tried to use it as such, and all were destroyed. But this is just a theory of mine, nothing concrete about it.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Thu4_2.1": "Today, I'm strengthening the wards that protect the valley. I'm happy to do the work of maintaining them despite their tedium.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Fri4.1": "It is curious to me why the Shrine demands gold for its use. If it was a construct of good, it shouldn't matter.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Fri4.2": "Yet, it will not work without a gold offering. Such a curious thing.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sat4": "There is no proof of any kind that the Shrine of Illusion is more powerful during summer or not. All other sorts of mysterious objects are, but it appears indifferent.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sun4_1.1": "I believe you to be a good person, @, so the Shrine should be kind to you. If I misjudged you, then...",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sun4_1.2": "You might still be fine. I'll have to see.",

	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Mon6.1": "My ex-wife was my companion. We did many things together, and during summer, when the energies are so potent, it was truly wonderful.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Mon6.2": "Now, I am alone in this tower. It is not the same, and probably will never be again.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Tue6.1": "I have the ability to create an image of any being and converse with it. However, they bore me, and I bore them.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Tue6.2": "They claim I need to get over my ex-wife, but it's easier said than done.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Wed6.1": "To be lucky in love is a special sort of energy that not all beings possess. It strikes randomly, and only once.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Wed6.2": "I have been hoping for another chance for many years, but to no avail.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Thu6.1": "I once conjured a being that was a talking cat. It would go on and on about facts from around the world, but it was only things I knew.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Thu6.2": "I couldn't bring myself to send it away, so I gave it to a friend. I wonder where it is now.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Fri6.1": "The summer full moon is a special one for me. I proposed to my ex-wife underneath its power.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Fri6.2": "It was...enchanting.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Fri6.3": "That was a very long time ago.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sat6.1": "It is a dangerous power to wonder about how things could have been. It is impossible to know, but it can be a destructive force.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sat6.2": "It's better to always do what you feel is right so you have no regrets. Doing what you feel is wrong, but doing it anyway, is madness.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sun6.1": "The days are long, @. I am in a slump, but I can feel a time when I will soon rise above it.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sun6.2": "I let the powers of the past take over me, and I tell you this, I will break free of them.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Mon8.1": "One of things I did when I was younger was hunt and fight evil beings and creatures. I've encountered them all.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Mon8.2": "There are beings in this world who still fight wars, the point of which long forgotten, replaced only with hatred of the enemy.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Mon8.3": "It is a tiring life, and I got out of it.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Tue8.1": "The problem with monsters is that most of the time they do not know why they do what they are doing.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Tue8.2": "Some are created, or others are enchanted in some terrible way. Have you seen any carry an object called a 'Strange Bun?'",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Tue8.3": "Beware the Strange Bun, @.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Wed8.1": " There was a war, fought long ago, that almost swallowed the entire world.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Wed8.2": "Unknown to humans, it was fought below the earth.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Wed8.3": "In the end, neither side won, and the warriors are forgotten. Such is the price they paid for their stupidity.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Wed8.4": "...I too joined in my youthful naivety.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Wed8.5": "Thus is the folly of the young.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Thu8.1": "In youth, my powers were attuned for fighting, and I could hold my own better than most. It was a heart-pounding time.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Thu8.2": "Unfortunately, it cost me countless years of my life. I have little to show for it other than the scars.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Fri8.1": "The mines go deeper than you might imagine, and there are secrets locked away that will probably never be found.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Fri8.2": "It is my hope that all the horrible things that happened down there stay there, and sometimes I must interfere.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sat8.1": "Anger and hatred, they are false energies. They hide the real sources of power, which are understanding and sadness.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sat8.2": "It has become cliche, but it's true. I have learned so much, and it still holds true. Find peace before you tear yourself to pieces.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sun8.1": "Someday things will be at peace with the beings in the mines, but not anytime soon. Probably not until the world is but a husk and humans are long gone.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sun8.2": "That is how deep their hatred burns. It is a tragedy of the ages.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Mon10.1": "Love is a difficult thing.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Mon10.2": "Even the youngest children grasp its importance somewhere deep within their psyche, but as one grows jaded, it becomes increasingly hard to find.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Mon10.3": "I am very old, @.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Mon10.4": "My life has been tempered by summits and valleys I've experienced in my countless years.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Mon10.5": "It is my hope that you find love, @. Be it romantic, platonic, familial or otherwise.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Mon10.6": "Do not become a jaded old antique locked within a tower as I have.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Tue10.1": "Ignorance is bliss. You've heard that saying before, I'm sure, but it's true. To know too much, it can turn one bitter.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Tue10.2": "I still find hope in my studies, but some days, it is nearly too much to bear.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Tue10.3": "To have a person to speak to has done more wonders than I expected.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Tue10.4": "You have grown to become an important person in my life, @.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Wed10.1": "The focus of my life has always been on my studies. Everything else fell away.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Wed10.2": "At times they were my only solace in a monotone existence.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Wed10.3": "Now I have a good friend to speak with. That is more than I have had in a long time.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Thu10.1": "Using the energies comes at a cost. It's not free. To discuss all the different aspects would take ages.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Thu10.2": "I'll tell you this though, @. My hair was not originally purple.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Thu10.3": "That was a long time ago...",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Fri10.1": "Thank you for visiting me, @.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Fri10.2": "How has your day gone? Well, I hope.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Fri10.3": "I would love to hear of it if you would share it with me.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sat10.1": "One can get so caught up in work that life just falls away. Others retreat to their work because they cannot handle their life.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sat10.2": "Sometimes I question which of the two I truly fall into.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sun10.1": "Recently, I have been reconsidering how I have been living my life.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sun10.2": "It is very efficient and I am still physically human, yes, but to call my lifestyle, 'human-like'...",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sun10.3": "What do I mean?",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sun10.4": "Humans have to eat, do they not?",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Summer_Sun10.5": "I do not.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_1.1": "Can you feel the changes in the air? I don't just mean in the temperature. The trees, they are giving off a unique energy.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_1.2": "May this fall be an enchanted one.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_26.1": "Hello, @. I will be occupied today with the festivities set for tomorrow.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_26.2": "I rarely take much interest in the activities of the townsfolk, but this event is the exception.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Mon.1": "They who live in the shadows are lost, for their world has moved beyond them. Pity those who have consumed the dark pastry.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Tue.1": "The creatures who slide on the earth, what is their purpose? Where do they come from?",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Tue.2": "They are known across the ages and cultures but a source for their being has never been found.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Wed.1": "Have you seen them? The golems that search for their long-dead creators.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Wed.2": "They will wander the mines forever, alone, until they run out of energy.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Thu.1": "Normal creature or monster? It's hard to tell of the bats that fly in the caves.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Thu.2": "Their energy fluctuates with the moon, and they crave the lifeblood of any they can. Beware their haunting gaze.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Fri.1": "There are creatures who have adapted to look like stone itself in the mines. It is not through magical means that they did so, rather through sheer will-power.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Fri.2": "Sometimes the only energy you need comes from within.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sat.1": "There are spirits, deep in the mines, who have wandered for eternity. Some of the first souls are still trapped in there.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sat.2": "They don't even resemble humans anymore, so twisted has their ethereal image become. Such a tragedy.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sun.1": "The mines were once a vast world that was compacted as a result of an ancient war.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sun.2": "Going through the layers is to pass through time itself. Be wary, for it is an unforgiving place.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sun.3": "Those creatures have lost more than their minds.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Mon2.1": "This season is special, for the power to be able to change is heightened. Be it your life, your thinking, or your surroundings, the powers of fall make it possible.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Mon2.2": "Choose wisely, however, for not all change is positive.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Tue2.1": "Focus on what matters, and all should work out, unless it doesn't. There are no guarantees in life.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Tue2.2": "In my studies, I have found this to be true, and it is unfortunate. Nothing is guaranteed to always work.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Wed2.1": "As the trees enter their slumber, they let loose their leaves and their energy. It is this energy that is useful to me.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Wed2.2": "Once winter comes, all the energies wane. Fall is the finale.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Thu2.1": "When all seems lost, it is important to remember that things can still change. For better, or for worse.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Thu2.2": "It is important not to give up, and to see it through to the end. Easier said than done, sometimes, but I've found it to be true.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Fri2.1": "I once saw a person try to keep a tree alive all year long, using powerful energies to do so.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Fri2.2": "It was horrible: the tree itself wept and begged to be freed. I had to step in and save the tree.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Fri2.3": "I still have some of its leaves it gave to me as a gift. They are special to me.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sat2.1": "My powers have begun to lose their potency, as it always is in fall. I would take from the trees, but I refuse to do so.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sat2.2": "To be as I am is to yield to the fickle movement of the planes. It is a fact I have accepted since long ago.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sun2": "You must be having some success on your farm to make it this far, @. How fare your crops?#$b#It is refreshing to see someone push through the difficulty and keep going. Your rewards are ahead of you.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Mon4.1": "Long ago, the Shrine of Illusion was in the hands of a group of assassins. They used its powers to change their appearance and make hits.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Mon4.2": "A very long time ago, indeed.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Tue4.1": "The assassins who used the Shrine of Illusion were almost unstoppable in their time. It took a group of people like myself to stop them.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Tue4.2": "It was a troubling time. An artifact like that should never be used for such gains.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Wed4.1": "With the Shrine of Illusion gone from the ranks of the assassins, their order crumbled. Many searched for it, to reclaim their honour, but alas.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Wed4.2": "Such is the way of those who used it for evil. It never worked out for them.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Thu4.1": "The Shrine of Illusion was lost for a time, and there is no known record for where it went.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Thu4.2": "Some like to believe it changed its own shape, and hid in the world somewhere, finding peace.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Fri4.1": "I feel bad for the assassins who were stuck in the form they chose after losing access to the Shrine of Illusion.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Fri4.2": "Their burden to bear, wearing a mask stitched on to their face forever. Chilling. Such is its power.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sat4.1": "It is impossible to converse with the Shrine of Illusion, yet I feel a living presence within it. I know it can hear me, but yet it remains silent.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sat4.2": "It makes a poor companion. It really just wants gold, and to be left alone, so I do the best I can.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sun4.1": "The Shrine of Illusion has amazing powers, and I am honoured to have it here in my tower.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sun4.2": "I think it feels safe, but it's hard to know with such artifacts.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sun4.3": "I would like to see someone try and break in here for it, though.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Mon6.1": "Here is a warning, @. Be careful during fall, for it is a time of enchantment.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Mon6.2": "The trees, as they go dormant, let loose their energies and their wishes. It can have some strange effects on people.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Tue6.1": "If you find yourself obsessed with something you've never been interested in before, it can mean you have been enchanted.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Tue6.2": "Not all enchantments are bad, of course. Some can be quite positive. It is very mysterious.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Wed6.1": "My ex-wife was very strong during fall. Her energies were off the charts.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Wed6.2": "I will admit, it made me jealous, and that didn't help things.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Wed6.3": "Sometimes I wonder if it's her enchanting people during fall...",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Thu6.1": "I need to focus on my experiments before the energies of fall are gone. Winter is a rough time.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Thu6.2": "If I can make a breakthrough, I'll ride the excitement till spring.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Fri6.1": "Many cultures around the world must be aware of the odd energies of fall. So many festivals about monsters are scattered throughout.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Fri6.2": "It was my favourite time of year as a child. Now, I must be on my guard.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sat6.1": "This is the time of harvest, so how has your farm been? Have you been able to get any special crops?",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sat6.2": "It is my hope that you do. Only through the hands of hard work can the true energy be found.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sun6.1": "The shadow brutes, have you seen them? Though many are monsters, there is one out there who isn't. Have you met him?",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sun6.2": "I have known of him for a long time. I hope he remains friendly.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Mon8.1": "Charms, enchantments, wards, spells... Though their powers are great and can do many things, they can't solve all of life's problems.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Mon8.2": "They cannot, for example, make someone fall in love with another and have it be an honest relationship. It never ends well.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Tue8.1": "When I was young, I found myself in a haunted house during a rainstorm and had to stay the night.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Tue8.2": "I saw many things that night, but the one that sticks with me is the spirit of a child, wandering the halls all night long.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Tue8.3": "It did not cry, it only looked for its parents. What's worse is, I thought I saw her parents fly around nearby her, but they couldn't see each other.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Wed8.1": "I do not want to become a ghost. It is my hope that when my time comes, I will be able to transcend to some higher plane.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Wed8.2": "I would be a terrible ghost, as well. I do not enjoy scaring people.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Thu8.1": "One of the oddities about my studies are the rules of certain things. For example, I can conjure familiars, obelisks, and more.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Thu8.2": "Yet, there are no powers at my disposal that can open a sealed jar of pickles or peanut butter. I have searched long and far, yet the rule remains.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Fri8.1": "I will be honest with you, @, I did not expect to last this long, and sometimes I wonder what I've done right.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Fri8.2": "Many people who lead this life give in to temptation, go too far, or give up on themselves. It amazes me that I have not.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sat8.1": "There is an odd feeling during this time of year for me. Things are at peace, and yet, I am worried.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sat8.2": "Maybe I'm just getting paranoid. I need to get out more.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sun8.1": "There is a part of me that wishes I could become enchanted, to live life free from knowing the secrets and be at peace. Yet, that would be impossible.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sun8.2": "I've studied too much, and learned things I cannot unlearn. It is a benefit, and yet also, a burden.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Mon10.1": "Studying and using the energies can make one very tired, @. All these years of it have brought me to the brink.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Mon10.2": "Yet it is my curiosity that drives me. I don't have all the answers, and there are still questions I have.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Tue10.1": "There have been times when I have had the chance to wield unlimited energy. Many would be tempted by such power.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Tue10.2": "I am only human. I was lucky to reject them, for it would have destroyed me.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Tue10.3": "All that glimmers is not always good, @.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Tue10.4": "Who knows what I would have become? A scary thought.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Wed10.1": "Am I a better person than I was before all this? In all my searching, have I been able to find a way to become stronger?",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Wed10.2": "I have answers to many mysteries, but they haven't changed me. They are only answers. Have I done all I can?",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Wed10.3": "I have thought about these things for a long time. My own mystery.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Thu10.1": "How has the season of harvest been treating you, @?",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Thu10.2": "Good, I hope.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Thu10.3": "It is a busy time for both of us.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Thu10.4": "I suspect there is not much either of us can complete in the depths of winter.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sat10.1": "Feel free to consult me if you encounter anything strange that you suspect is magical in nature.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sat10.2": "I would be happy to offer assistance to a good friend.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sun10.1": "It is difficult to remember what it is to have normal conversations. When conversing with the energies, one must speak a unique and complex language.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sun10.2": "To talk human is to ask how another is, and to do that with meaning is hard for me. Luckily, I can practice on you.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Fall_Sun10.3": "What's up, dog? No? Is that not a saying?",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_1.1": "It is a time for peace and study. The shifting of the planes has made me weak, and I will rest.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_1.2": "I hope this is a special winter for you, @.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Mon.1": "The snow is beautiful, isn't it? It has special properties that give it an enchanting aura.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Mon.2": "I enjoy watching it. It is very calming.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Tue.1": "During winter, as my power is at its weakest, I enjoy reading books in my collection.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Tue.2": "I have so many interesting books, that I wonder if I'll ever get the chance to read them all.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Wed.1": "I've just finished a book recently about the many types of monsters. I had forgotten a few from ages past.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Wed.2": "Terrible beasts that would roam the world during winter when they knew they couldn't be stopped. I'm glad they are gone.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Thu.1": "The ice is a friend and a foe, isn't it? Friend when you have a hot beverage, foe when you want to plant crops.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Thu.2": "Some of my friends specialize in studying ice in all forms, and their studies are double-edged indeed.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Fri.1": "There are still some books left in this world that can impart special abilities on those who read them.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Fri.2": "Some can teach the reader entire languages if they have all four copies. Imagine that.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sat.1": "It is now time to meditate till the spring when the energies of the region return. To do any of my experiments now would be a mistake.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sat.2": "Luckily, I have many things to read and think about, so not all is lost.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sun.1": "Much is still unknown amongst my contemporaries about winter. As our energies are at their weakest, it makes it difficult to study.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sun.2": "We are a rare breed, thus it's unlikely we invent a way to circumvent the shifting of the planes in the near future.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Mon2.1": "Have you read any good books recently?",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Mon2.2": "The majority of my catalogue is reference material for my research but I do sometimes pick up a novel I find intriguing.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Tue2.1": "When I visit a new location, I often go out of my way to peruse local libraries.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Tue2.2": "One thing that never fails to peeve me is blatant vandalism.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Tue2.3": "Why anyone would think it is acceptable to fold the corners or mark perfectly preserved pages is beyond me!",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Wed2.1": "What you call 'fantasy novels' I call 'comedy.' It amazes me all the things they get wrong.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Wed2.2": "However, I'd be worried if they got things right. Our secrets aren't for the public, you know.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Thu2": "When I read novels, I tend to like the ones that have a lot of intricate world building.#$b#It fascinates me how the human mind is able to stitch together an entire imaginary world.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Fri2": "I recently found a book written in a language I had never seen before. Upon closer inspection, it's for people who code.#$b#This book claims to be from the beginning of the universe...what could it mean?",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sat2.1": "I am told that novels must be reenacted, recorded, and distributed all over the world to reach widespread renown in the modern era.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sat2.2": "'Movies'...?",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sat2.3": "Yes! Indeed! I was talking about movies!",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sat2.4": "It is a concept I am familiar with, yes.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sun2.1": "I have been considering familiarizing myself with an invention called a 'computer'.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sun2.2": "Such a device is required to access some sort of an invisible web that accumulates knowledge from individuals all over the world.#$b#How does this web function? Does it have keepers that affix information to it? Is it spun by some manner of invisible spider?",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sun2.3": "...I fear I may have misunderstood the concept entirely.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Mon4.1": "The Shrine of Illusion has a unique origin, however there are many variations.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Mon4.2": "Some believe it was born from the sun itself and crashed as a meteor. Others say it has always been.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Mon4.3": "The truth is far more interesting.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Tue4.1": "The being who created the Shrine of Illusion was none other than a young girl, who wished on a stone to change her appearance to escape her terrible life.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Tue4.2": "The stone granted her this power and she turned into a hawk and flew away. When the girl's father found out, he raged.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Tue4.3": "He then threw the rock into a lake, to be forgotten forever.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Tue4.4": "Come back tomorrow and I'll tell you the rest.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Wed4.1": "The Shrine of Illusion, as a rock, needed to get out of the lake it was thrown in, so it absorbed all the gold at the bottom of the lake until it shone magnificently.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Wed4.2": "It attracted the girl who had become a hawk and told her what had happened.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Wed4.3": "To get revenge, the shrine turned the girl into a bear and she scared her father.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Wed4.4": "I'll tell you more tomorrow.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Thu4.1": "The Father, realizing what he'd done, pulled the Shrine out of the Lake and begged for forgiveness. The girl flew away, but the Shrine demanded it be taken to the king.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Thu4.2": "Once at the king, the story stops. The kingdom, the king, the girl, what happened to them is lost to history.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Thu4.3": "Bit anti-climactic, but such is the way with stories of this nature. Why not ask the Shrine yourself?",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Fri4.1": "I personally believe the Shrine of Illusion has a grand purpose not yet realized. What it could be exactly I'm not sure of, yet I feel it.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Fri4.2": "Will it ever return to being a humble stone? Is it waiting for the return of the girl-turned-hawk? Many secrets still remain.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sat4.1": "The Shrine of Illusion can only change our appearance and does not turn us into animals, yet it's recorded that it has.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sat4.2": "I wonder if I could unlock that ability again? Maybe if I ask with a sweet voice.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sun4.1": "I've been reading up on legends of old lately and found a new one that the Shrine of Illusion was involved in.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sun4.2": "There once was a frog who wished to be human and it asked the Shrine for such a wish.$0#$b#The Shrine granted him his desire, but demanded gold. The frog had no gold, so as a human, he stole some. The frog was then thrown in jail and that's where he died.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sun4.3": "Brutal, isn't it? I feel bad for the frog.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Mon6.1": "Winter is a difficult season for me.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Mon6.2": "My mind often wanders to unproductive places no matter how many books I try to distract myself with.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Mon6.3": "I hope you will have a better season than I.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Tue6.1": "It is often during winter that I am plagued by nightmares and regrets of the past.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Tue6.2": "No just solely of my ex-wife, but of the things I have done and the lives I have taken.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Tue6.3": "My hope is that you never must live as I have, @.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Wed6.1": "Regret is a poison that seeps into every crevice a person possesses.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Wed6.2": "How deeply its fangs sink into the soul...",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Wed6.3": "Yet, the only way to rid of it is to embrace the present and future.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Wed6.4": "How difficult such simple concepts are to embody.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Thu6.1": "Thank you for coming to visit me.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Thu6.2": "I know I am not pleasant to be around this time of year.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Thu6.3": "Our friendship has grown very important to me.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Fri6.1": "Even I was once very young and full of passion.#$b#The frustration I once felt from the slow passage of time has long been eroded by my many years. Now it passes far too quickly.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Fri6.2": "Youth is fleeting in mind even if not in body for some. Hold on to it while you can.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sat6.1": "To make mistakes is to be human, yet the mistakes I have made far surpass those of a single person in a single lifetime.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sat6.2": "I wish for us to share many years of friendship, @, but I would not wish upon you such an emotional burden.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sun6.1": "Today I will focus on the positive things. I have a new friend in you, @. For that I am thankful.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sun6.2": "Here's to spring coming soon! It will be wonderful.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Mon8.1": "It has been a long time since I've had such a close conversation partner.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Mon8.2": "Wizards are often the reclusive type.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Mon8.3": "I am glad that has not prevented you from visiting me even in the dead of winter, @.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Tue8.1": "To live this existence is to have too much time yet not enough in the same instance.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Tue8.2": "No matter how long a person may wish for a moment to last, it will always inevitably pass.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Tue8.3": "Grasp the present, @. Do not let it slip through your fingers as I often have.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Wed8.1": "...Ah, @. It's good to see you. Please give me a moment. I'm a little...",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Wed8.2": "Perhaps we should speak another day. I'm in need of some time alone.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Thu8.1": "My apologies for yesterday.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Thu8.2": "I have not been sleeping very well lately. It is something I often must deal with during this season.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Thu8.3": "I will manage on my own.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Fri8.1": "The energies I study are often a force of healing, however there are more ethical concerns to my work than one would commonly expect.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Fri8.2": "What if one could cure the dead? Or perhaps even stop people from death? Would that be a power for good, or evil?",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Fri8.3": "What if you charged people for immortality? What if only the rich lived forever?",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Fri8.4": "Such are the countless questions thrust upon me.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Fri8.5": "I have yet to find an answer to any of them.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sat8.1": "I've read a novel in which a man gets smarter, but his body disappears until he's nothing less than a husk.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sat8.2": "The last line was, 'and to think for a moment, I could understand forever.' I know how that character feels.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sun8.1": "Have you ever wondered how one enters this path?",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sun8.2": "For me, it was my failure to save my mother.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sun8.3": "My master heard of my struggles and thought I showed promise in the arts.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sun8.4": "Not all tales are so tragic, however.#$b#The majority today are simply found to have talent and asked to make a decision.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Mon10.1": "It is good to see you, @. I am....",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Mon10.2": "Forgive me. I often do not sleep well during winter.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Mon10.3": "Can you please come back tomorrow? I am not currently in the mood for chatting.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Tue10.1": "My apologies for yesterday, @. I am much better today.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Tue10.2": "Come, warm yourself by the fire. Tell me of your plans for the season.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Wed10.1": "Hello, @. I suspect that you have been occupying your free time with the mines?",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Wed10.2": "Please take heed if you tread its deepest levels.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Wed10.3": "Evil and dangerous things live far below what is easily accessible within its tunnels.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Thu10.1": "Learning and studying have been my focus for such a long time, I've forgotten how old I actually am.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Thu10.2": "Referencing events I've experienced place me somewhere around a thousand, but it is difficult to know for sure.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Fri10.1": "My relationship with time is a complex one.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Fri10.2": "At times I feel as if it stretches at infinitum, but others it slips through my fingers like the dry sands of the desert.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Fri10.3": "Such is the nature of my existence.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Fri10.4": "I plan to cherish the time we have together, @, no matter how long or short it may be.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sat10.1": "I have not asked, but how has your relationship with the townsfolk been?#$b#Good, I hope.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sat10.2": "I would not wish for you to isolate yourself for the sake of visiting an old wizard in a tower.",
	"Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sat10.3": "You deserve to have more in your life than solely what I am able to provide.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sat10.4": "...It is my sincere hope that you find happiness, @.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sun10.1": "As the season inches towards a close, I feel my powers slowly beginning to swell once more.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.Winter_Sun10.2": "It is always a relief. I am far less vulnerable to night terrors when more of my wards are active.",

  "Premarriage.Wizard.1H.Response1": "Excellent. You have been chosen for an important task, @. Do not falter.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.1H.Response2": "...The spirits in the Community Center? Have you forgotten already? I thought to find you more keen of mind. Well, no matter. Do try not to disappoint them, won't you?",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.1H.Response3": "Not precisely the confidence-inspiring answer I had hoped for, but no matter.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.2H.Response1": "Hmm... have you indeed? Interesting.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.2H.Response2": "...That would be a slime. I shall not pass your ignorance along to them; for that, you may count yourself lucky.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.2H.Response3": "I am hardly surprised.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.3H.Response1": "Is it, indeed? I had no idea. Though it seems impractical to summon you forth whenever we wish to speak about you, I will endeavour to do so in the future. I thank you for teaching me this nicety.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.3H.Response2": "We were.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.3H.Response_1": "Yes, I sensed you might say that. The spirits have chosen well; I trust you will do great things.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.3H.Response_2": "Nevertheless, you must. Seldom are we given any choice in such matters. Sooner or later you will have to make a decision... for better or for worse.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.3H.Response_3": "Mmm. It is a dark energy that swirls around you. I hope only that it will not destroy you. These are dangerous powers you meddle with. Tread carefully.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.6H.Response1_1": "What is the scene? How proceeds your life? What is popping?",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.6H.Response1_2": "Indeed! I have had an eye-opening experience with a modern invention called the television.",

  "Premarriage.Wizard.8H.Response4_2": "I have tried that. To no avail.",
  "Premarriage.Wizard.8H.Response4_3": "That... is a nice sentiment. I fear thoughts of where I have come from will only sabotage my efforts, however.",

  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Mon1.1": "You've arrived, my love.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Mon1.2": "I was hoping to see you today.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Mon1.3": "I have recently begun expanding my studies on elements of courtship in this era and I wish to hear your opinion.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Mon1.4": "What quantifies a date compared to simply an outing?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Mon1.5": "What exactly is the correct number of dates one should go on?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Mon1.6": "Does one amazing date surpass many small, mundane dates, or are continuous minor gestures more preferable?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Mon1.7": "...Ah. Was my approach wrong to begin with?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Mon1.8": "It seems my research efforts have been lacking on this topic.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Mon1.9": "Don't worry, @! I will master the art of modern courtship!",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Mon1.10": "Even if it kills me!",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Mon2.1": "It has been a long time since I've been in a relationship such as this.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Mon2.2": "Forgive me if I'm somewhat awkward in my clumsy affections.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Mon3.1": "To love earnestly is to entrust parts of one's self to another.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Mon3.2": "It has been a long time since I've felt comfortable doing so.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Mon3.3": "Thank you always for showing me such understanding and compassion, @.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Mon4.1": "Hmm, another story of my youth?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Mon4.2": "Once, while lost in a forest, I found a cabin and took shelter in it.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Mon4.3": "It was larger than it appeared on the inside and it seemed to go on for miles.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Mon4.4": "At the end, I found a bed and in it, a child. Its eyes were open and it rose to stare at me.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Mon4.5": "It pointed at me and I awoke in my bed at the inn. Very strange. I still wonder about it.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue1.1": "I am glad to see you, @.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue1.2": "I had predicted we would become friends, but I had no idea how far it would go.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue1.3": "There are many mysteries in this world and I am glad you chose me as one of yours.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue1.4": "I count myself to be very lucky indeed.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue2.1": "You know, despite living outside the town, I enjoy catching glimpses of the lives of those in this valley.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue2.2": "As for yours, however...",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue2.3": "I much prefer to be part of it.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue3.1": "In my youth, the libraries would be brimming with life. Every page a portal, recorded down by scribes long past.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue3.2": "Some were full of secrets no one should know and I took to them immediately. I regret it still.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue3.3": "What do I mean by that?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue3.4": "I am sure I have mentioned it before, but to know too much is a burden, @.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue3.5": "Even if the secrets themselves do not haunt your understanding of the world, having knowledge poses an implicit responsibility on most moral people.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue3.6": "To feel as if the world will crumble on top of your shoulders if you do not act...",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue3.7": "It is no way to live.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue4.1": "I have been studying more modern day literature in an attempt to grasp the way people of this era communicate.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue4.2": "...I may have flipped through a romance or two when I had the spare time.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue4.3": "I must admit, I do not understand the appeal of what many describe as a 'will they, won't they' cycle.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue4.4": "It is not frustrating to witness two people clearly have feelings for one another while refusing to take the final step?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue4.5": "Hmm? Should I be the one speaking on such matters?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue4.6": "Of course I should! I had the courage to take leap, did I not?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Tue4.7": "...Not to say that I have much else going in my favour.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Wed1.1": "Many people are scared of me. The unknown causes them to tremble and my association with it frightens them.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Wed1.2": "You have continued to show you don't mind the mysterious. You embrace it and take time out of your day to see me.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Wed1.3": "Thank you, @. I thought I would be alone forever.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Wed1.4": "You are a special person, indeed.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Wed2.1": "It is good to see you, @!",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Wed2.2": "I am always delighted by your visits, no matter what the context.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Wed2.3": "Come, tell me of your day thus far! I long to hear everything.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Wed3.1": "The world I once knew is long gone. I hold on to fragments of it, but I am old. Someday, it will all be forgotten.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Wed3.2": "I'd like to tell you about it, @, but to do so would pull you deeper into the maelstrom.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Wed3.3": "Perhaps, one day when we are truly joined in both mind and soul.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Wed4.1": "How has the new year been for you thus far, my love?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Wed4.2": "Productive, I hope.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Wed4.3": "Make sure to take proper breaks and meals. I would not want to hear news of you fainting from exhaustion while tolling away for the new growing season.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Wed4.4": "Hmm? What about me?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Wed4.5": "I am perfectly fine.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Wed4.6": "Yes, you are correct about me rarely taking meals, but the energies are plenty for sustaining me.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Wed4.7": "...Cook... for me?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Wed4.8": "You do not need to go that above and beyond for my sake, my love.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Wed4.9": "...but I would not reject such displays of affection.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu1.1": "The energies, at their core, are chaotic. Ever-changing, they are denser than air yet more elusive than wind.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu1.2": "In the end, many people believed it was not worth trying to solve the mystery, yet here I remain.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu1.3": "Someday, @, I will truly understand.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu2.1": "Are you staying safe, @?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu2.2": "I have to admit, I've grown a little protective of you. Perhaps I'll put together a charmed amulet of defence.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu2.3": "It's up to you if you want to wear it, of course.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu3.1": "Forgive me for my poor mood today, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu3.2": "My ex-wife has been causing trouble around the valley once again.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu3.3": "It is my responsibility to make sure she does not inflict too much damage.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu3.4": "...Why?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu3.5": "...I'm afraid that is a difficult question to answer in the present moment.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu3.6": "Rather than solely my personal hangups, this is a matter relating back to the Ministry.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu3.7": "We will have to wait until you are properly sworn in before I can divulge such matters.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu4.1": "What are your thoughts on travelling, @?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu4.2": "It has been very long since I'd spent my looking for the secrets of the energies and planes that govern our existence.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu4.3": "I've had grand adventures.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu4.4": "Suffered terrible tragedies.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu4.5": "...And committed many mistakes.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu4.6": "Still, I do not regret seeing the world, even if I was not ready to appreciate its true beauty.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu4.7": "Do not forsake your own drive and passion, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Thu4.8": "They are energies that will push you far.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Fri1.1": "I feel renewed this year, not just because spring is the time for it, but because of my relationship with you, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Fri1.2": "You have reminded me that I am still human. To focus on being human is a mystery itself that I almost forgot about.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Fri1.3": "Thank you, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Fri2.1": "Any plans for the weekend?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Fri2.2": "I would be honoured if you'd like to spend part of it with me.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Fri2.3": "I am still studying the concept of 'dates'.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Fri2.4": "I hope you'll accept when I finally become well versed enough invite to you on one.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Fri3.1": "How have you fared in your walks to and from the tower?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Fri3.2": "I imagine it's not very convenient to run so deep into the forest simply to see me.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Fri3.3": "I have considered placing a warp portal of some sort on your farm, but I'm afraid it may be slightly too conspicuous considering our tensions with the Ministry.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Fri3.4": "I will figure something out. Until then, I hope you are enjoying the fresh spring air at least.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Fri4.1": "Hmm. More stories of my youth, is it?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Fri4.2": "Not all my adventuring days were filled with fighting and conflict.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Fri4.3": "At times, I would successfully convince my ex-wife, who was my travelling companion at the time, to walk the libraries in large cities.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Fri4.4": "Even if you cannot understand the language, to be surrounded by so many books is an inspiring feeling.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Fri4.5": "They were rare moments, however.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Fri4.6": "In that time, books were a luxury not many could read, let alone afford, each one a work of art penned by hand; crystallizations of a scholar's pursuit of knowledge or the raw capital of local lords and the church.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Fri4.7": "I used to spend hours enraptured by them, absorbing it all.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Fri4.8": "Many are long lost to the sands of time and it is a shame.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sat1.1": "The air is electric, I feel this year will be a special one. Let us do our best to achieve our dreams, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sat1.2": "Do not give up. I will be with you.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sat2.1": "I should find some time to research methods of teaching magic.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sat2.2": "Even from our short time together, your budding potential is inspiring.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sat2.3": "Rare it is to find such a promising pupil and in time, I will teach you much.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sat2.4": "It's my hope that we will be together for many years, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sat2.5": "I hope you agree, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sat3.1": "Ah, it is finally the weekend.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sat3.2": "Sadly, neither of our professions allow for the rest afforded in the modern work week.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sat3.3": "Monsters do not simply go home if it is the weekend after all!",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sat3.4": "Still, I would love to simply take a moment to chat with you, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sat3.5": "How has the farm fared so far? I would love to hear of your week!",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sat4.1": "Are you taking proper precautions in the mines, @?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sat4.2": "I often hear of your impressive accomplishments clearing those tunnels from Marlon during our occasional Order meetings.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sat4.3": "Here, take this elixir.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sat4.4": "I often avoid relying on such things, but they are important to have nonetheless.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun1.1": "The greatest energies are the ones we allow ourselves to find. Everything else is false.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun1.2": "Be true to what moves you and you will be energized the rest of your life.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun1.3": "That is my hope for you, @. Live forever!",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun2.1": "We should take a trip together into the forest soon, @...",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun2.2": "There are all kinds of secret places I'd like to show you now that spring has arrived.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun3.1": "You wish to hear another story from my adventuring days?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun3.2": "I'm afraid I am sorely lacking in happy tales to share.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun3.3": "If you would still like to hear one, there is another I can share.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun3.4": "This took place around the time when my ex-wife and I had stopped seeing eye to eye on how we'd handled the requests granted to us.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun3.5": "We had gotten separated from one another during an immense storm called forth by a formidable, monstrous, winged serpent.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun3.6": "So intense was the rain that you could barely see your hands in front of your face.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun3.7": "To make matters worse, our chase had brought us beside a wide river delta, the sudden influx of waters threatening to wash away all the nearby settlements",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun3.8": "The reason we were separated? She insisted on cornering the monster before it potentially escaped into the sea while I wanted to make sure we would not drown countless settlements in the process.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun3.9": "In the end, our argument was unnecessary because the beast thought it wise to ambush me in the middle of my reinforcement spells!",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun3.10": "Least to say everything around me was swept away by a torrent of stones and mud.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun3.11": "My ex-wife noticed the commotion and made short work of the serpent before it could recover.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun3.12": "What of the settlements?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun3.13": "I was able to protect the majority of them, but one village suffered terrible losses, the majority of their homes lost to the sea.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun3.14": "Not my greatest moment, I must admit.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun3.15": "Such creatures have long since disappeared from the surface, content to remain deep underground where they belong after the conclusion of the Elemental Wars.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun3.16": "I sincerely hope they do not return.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun4.1": "Ah, is that the scent of flowers lingering on your clothes?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun4.2": "I never tire of the petal storms this valley produces.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun4.3": "How wondrous it is to stand amongst one!",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_Sun4.4": "...Assuming one does not possess allergies, at least.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_12_2.1": "I am due to inspect the barrier placed on the town today.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_12_2.2": "I would ask if you'd like to join me, but it would be a very dull experience for you.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Spring_12_2.3": "Perhaps once you truly establish a foundation in the arts.",

  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon1.1": "I still marvel that you would ever choose to be with one such as me. I am much too old and jaded for someone so full of life. And yet, here we are.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon1.2": "You are the mystery I will never solve. Be well, @.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon1.3": "I had considered it to be asking for too much when I originally considered the prospect of us being together.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon1.4": "Now I regret not speaking up sooner!",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon1.5": "How wonderful it is that we've found each other in such a vast world.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon2.1": "Have you encountered ghosts within the mines, @?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon2.2": "I consider them the most interesting beings that haunt the valley's tunnels.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon2.3": "Unlike undead born of human intervention, often at the hands of a necromancer, the ghosts of the mines appear entirely natural.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon2.4": "They do not read to me like the remnants of a single soul, but the collected impressions of many.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon2.5": "Very fascinating, indeed.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon2.6": "I am looking forward to studying them in more detail.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon2.7": "...You wish to help?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon2.8": "I must admit, you have shown yourself to be an adventurer of a much higher calibre than even I expected.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon2.9": "We will see.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon2.10": "...In truth, I simply do not wish to put you in danger.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon2.11": "I have seen far too many fall before their prime over the years.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon3.1": "Have you reached the bottom of the mines, @?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon3.2": "In truth, it runs far deeper than merely what we are able to reach by simply exploring its tunnels.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon3.3": "I'm sure you've noticed the oddity of its existence, @.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon3.4": "In truth, the 'mines' were originally a far larger network that was compressed at the end of the Elemental Wars.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon3.5": "To travel through the different regions is to peek into the past itself.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon3.6": "Thus is the nature of the seal placed upon those tunnels.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon3.7": "As the Wizard of the valley, it is my duty to ensure it be handled with caution, especially now that ones such as yourself explore the depths in search of ore and minerals.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon3.8": "Do contact me if you find anything odd, however.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon3.9": "I suspect there is much more hidden beneath than merely my seals.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon4.1": "Can I say that you look quite fetching today, @?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Male.Summer_Mon4.2": "I often do not pay much attention to matters of vanity, but when I see you, I cannot help but be amazed someone of your form took interest in me of all people.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Female.Summer_Mon4.2": "I often do not pay much attention to matters of vanity, but when I see you, I cannot help but be amazed someone of your beauty took interest in me of all people.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon4.3": "Do tell me if you would like some relief from this heat, however.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Mon4.4": "As appealing as I find your slightly flushed face, I would rather you not suffer a heat stroke.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Tue1.1": "Ignorance is bliss. You've heard that saying before, I'm sure, but it's true. To know too much, it can turn one bitter.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Tue1.2": "I still find hope in my studies, but some days, it is nearly too much to bear. Thank you for choosing me, @.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Summer_Tue1.3": "You are what holds me to this reality.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Tue2.1": "It is strange. I never imagined I would find love again so soon after my last failed attempt.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Tue2.2": "Such are the ways of fate and destiny. Even magic practitioners such as I are forever at her mercy.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Tue2.3": "To divine is to attempt to peer behind the veil, but even the greatest diviner only glimpses fragments of fate's grand plan.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Tue2.4": "All I ask is that she remains kind after already granting me one miracle.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Tue3.1": "Ah! Thank you for visiting me, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Tue3.2": "I wish I could offer you something cool to drink.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Tue3.3": "This heat is insufferable even for me!",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Tue3.4": "Hmm? Take off my robes?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Tue3.5": "It would take far more than this to force me to disrobe.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Tue3.6": "I'd endured the Fern Islands after all!",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Tue4.1": "Practicing magic and modern science intersect more often than most expect.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Tue4.2": "Both rely on fundamental rules of our plane, but where one seeks to exploit the mechanics, the other bends reality itself.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Tue4.3": "It is why I find studies that attempt to combine the two fascinating.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Tue4.4": "It is not anywhere close to my expertise, but I am often excited by the novel ideas the new generation produces.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Tue4.5": "I look forward to the day you bring your unique spark to our world as well!",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Wed1.1": "The focus of my life has always been on my studies. Everything else fell away.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Wed1.2": "Becoming close with you has made me realize that maybe I should not be so consumed by the search for knowledge.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Wed1.3": "There's more to life than reading the books about the lives of the dead.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Wed1.4": "Now there is you.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Wed1.5": "I am with you, @. I always will be.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Wed2.1": "You are brilliant, @. ",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Wed2.2": "I would be remiss if I did not remind you of that fact every day we are together.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Wed2.3": "For you to have given me, of all people, a chance. What can it be other than a miracle?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Wed3.1": "How are you doing today, @?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Wed3.2": "My powers are at their peak during summer so it is often a period of intense research for me.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Wed3.3": "This year, however, I am taking things at a slower pace.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Wed3.4": "How else could I enjoy time with you?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Wed4.1": "I have recently begun considering revisiting areas of study I'd since abandoned over the centuries or even potentially incorporating new ones.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Wed4.2": "I have always been drawn to plants, but it would not be bad to consider researching animals as well.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Wed4.3": "Hmm? Why the consideration?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Wed4.4": "...You are raising animals on your farm, are you not?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Wed4.5": "If I am able to lend you assistance, I consider it plenty reward for any efforts.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Thu2.1": "Are you staying safe, @?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Thu2.2": "I have to admit, I've grown a little protective of you. Perhaps, I'll put together a charmed amulet of defence.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Thu2.3": "It's up to you if you want to wear it, of course.",
	"UnDating.Wizard.Summer_ThuEx.1": "Ah, when we should inform the town...?",
	"UnDating.Wizard.Summer_ThuEx.2": "Forgive me, @.",
	"UnDating.Wizard.Summer_ThuEx.3": "Love is a complicated thing for those such as I.",
	"UnDating.Wizard.Summer_ThuEx.4": "I will ask that you remain patient for a while longer.",
	"UnDating.Wizard.Summer_ThuEx.5": "Why?",
	"UnDating.Wizard.Summer_ThuEx.6": "...That is a difficult question to answer.",
	"UnDating.Wizard.Summer_ThuEx.7": "Make no mistake, I would never be ashamed of our relationship!",
	"UnDating.Wizard.Summer_ThuEx.8": "...It is simply that certain aspects of the world do not agree with a coupling such as ours and I would not want to subject you to that before either of us is ready.",
	"UnDating.Wizard.Summer_ThuEx.9": "I understand if you are frustrated, but please bear with me, @..",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Thu3.1": "...How would you judge our relationship, @?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Thu3.2": "You know my opinion, but you seldom speak of your own.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Thu3.3": "I hope I am not failing too badly.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Thu3.4": "It has been a very long time since I've actually engaged in proper romance.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Thu3.5": "...And I was not much of a romantic person to begin with.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Thu3.6": "Perhaps, that too is a reason why I was always doomed to repeated failure...",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Thu4.1": "Ah, @! How is the farm doing?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Thu4.2": "I hope you are not pushing yourself too hard to work amidst this heat.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Thu4.3": "Perhaps I'll put together a charm of cooling you can keep on your persons.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Thu4.4": "You would have to come visit me to recharge it, however.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Thu4.5": "...Yet another reason to draw you to the tower, no?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Fri1.1": "Thank you for spending time with me, @. I was hoping you would come by today.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Fri1.2": "It's nice to take a break from my experiments and talk with you. How is your farm?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Fri1.3": "It is my hope you are successful in all your doings.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Fri2.1": "Any plans for the weekend?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Fri2.2": "I would be honoured if you'd like to spend part of it with me.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Fri2.3": "I've made sure the cooling wards around the tower are fully charged to grant you a bit of comfort in this heat.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Fri3.1": "The smell of honey and overripe fruit is heavy in the air.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Fri3.2": "I am not often tempted by such earthly desires, but even I experience cravings on the odd occasion.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Fri3.3": "I may see if I can conjure some dessert for us to share at some point.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Fri3.4": "It is a rather delicate task, so please don't be disappointed if it does not materialize as expected.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Fri4.1": "I am indebted to you in more ways than one, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Fri4.2": "It is not merely your companionship that has significantly impacted my life, but your fresh perspective as well. ",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Fri4.3": "I only hope that you've also grown in the course of our time together.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sat1.1": "One can get so caught up in work that life just falls away. Others retreat to their work because they cannot handle their life.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sat1.2": "I'm realizing lately that I've done a lot of things that I wasn't happy with. Forced myself to do what was wrong for what I thought was right.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sat1.3": "I hope to someday get forgiveness, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sat1.4": "Someday.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sat2.1": "I am a heavily flawed person, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sat2.2": "No single person lives as long as I have without their share of mistakes, but mine are particularly heavy and numerous.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sat2.3": "I am wholly undeserving of your love, but if you insist on sharing it with me, I would cherish those feelings forever more.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sat2.4": "That is my promise to you.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sat3.1": "Ah! @! Brilliant timing!",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sat3.2": "I have managed to conjure something you may be interested in!",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sat3.3": "It is not as cooling as I'd hoped, but the taste of berries is delightful.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sat3.4": "It is infused with magic so it should assist you with your daily activities.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sat3.5": "I hope you enjoy it, my love.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sat4.1": "There are certain experiments that can only be performed during the height of summer when my energies are at their most productive.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sat4.2": "I try to make the best of my time, but the appalling temperatures put a damper on things.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sat4.3": "Hmm? What is this 'air conditioning' you speak of? Why does the air need to be conditioned?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sat4.4": "No need to concern yourself with me, @. I will figure out a solution on my own.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sat4.5": "I have been at this for practically a millennium after all!",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sun1.1": "There is a special energy in the air today. I can feel it, can you?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sun1.2": "It is our energy! It is invigorating. It makes me feel young again.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sun1.3": "Is that weird? I don't get out much, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sun2.1": "We should take a trip together into the forest soon, @...",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sun2.2": "There are all kinds of secret places I'd like to show you.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sun3.1": "I have not looked forward to 'tomorrow' in a long time, @...",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sun3.2": "Yet, I cannot be anything but excited with each new day now that you have entered my life.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sun3.3": "How dramatically a change in perspective impacts one's view.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sun4.1": "Despite the abundant energies present during the season, I always seem to run out of mana by the end of the day.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sun4.2": "I've considered flipping my schedule so I can attempt to sleep through the sweltering days, but there is a good chance I would miss your visit.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sun4.3": "I will simply have to make do, I suppose.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sun5.1": "Are you hot, @? I imagine the forest didn't provide much relief on such a blistering day.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sun5.2": "...It may be presumptuous to ask, but would you like to come into my cloak to cool down for a moment?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sun5.3": "I must reserve mana for tonight, but I have already cast a temperature-regulation spell on myself...",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_Sun5.4": "The range is a little small so...",
	"Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Summer_Sun5.5": "%I inch a little closer to Magnus.",
	"Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Summer_Sun5.6": "...!",
	"Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Summer_Sun5.7": "%Magnus suddenly jumped back...",
	"Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Summer_Sun5.8": "Actually! I was wrong! I have the mana to spare so I'll cast it on you, too!",
	"Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Summer_Sun5.9": "Sorry for making an odd suggestion.",
	"Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Summer_Sun5.10": "Blushing?",
	"Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Summer_Sun5.11": "Who is blushing?",
	"Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Summer_Sun5.12": "I do not know what you're speaking of.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Int.Summer_Sun5.5": "%Magnus wrapped me in his cloak...",
	"Dating.Wizard.Int.Summer_Sun5.6": "%It's really nice and cool!",
	"Dating.Wizard.Int.Summer_Sun5.7": "Feeling better?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Int.Summer_Sun5.8": "I'm glad. I would not want my lovely partner to suffer after all.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Int.Summer_Sun5.9": "Hmm? Why, I'm offended you would think my suggestion had ulterior motives.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Int.Summer_Sun5.10": "I am simply helping you prevent a heat stroke.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Int.Summer_Sun5.11": "Anything else is merely a side benefit.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Int.Summer_Sun5.12": "...That I am enjoying greatly.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_25.1": "...It is difficult to express my feelings after closing myself to others for so long, but I wanted to thank you, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_25.2": "What you've provided me is far greater than mere companionship for the long days.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_25.3": "One day I will find the words to express my full thoughts to you, but I'm afraid today is not the day.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_25.4": "For now, please accept my sincere gratitude.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_25.5": "You have granted a very old wizard some rare happiness in his long life.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Summer_25.6": "There is not enough thanks I can give for merely that alone.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_1.1": "Ah, so the season of change is upon us once more.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_1.2": "My powers always begin to wane this time of year so it would be wise of you to take heed, @.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_1.3": "Monsters and unpredictable magics are most active in autumn.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_1.4": "For most, it is merely an enchanting time, but I suspect that your innate talent and the time you spend in my tower may potentially pull curious entities towards you.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_1.5": "I've had no less than ten inquiries from across the plane today alone.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_1.6": "Do not worry. I am always here to watch over you.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_1.7": "May this fall be an uneventful, but productive one!",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Mon1.1": "Studying and using the energies can make one very tired, @. All these years of it have brought me to the brink.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Mon1.2": "Yet it is my curiosity that drives me. I don't have all the answers and there are still questions I have.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Mon1.3": "Like you, @. What continues to bring you back to me, time and again?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Mon1.4": "Perhaps someday I will understand you.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Mon1.5": "Then again, I enjoy the mystery.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Mon2.1": "How goes the effort with the community center?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Mon2.2": "I suspect it plays a pivotal role within your fate...",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Mon2.3": "I have yet to discover in what manner, but I suspect it to be something largely positive.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Tue2.1": "You have become very important to me over the course of the year, @. ",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Tue2.2": "It is my hope that I have conveyed that to you through my actions, but sometimes the best solution is to simply speak the truth plainly.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Tue2.3": "...Even if it is a little embarrassing.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Wed2.1": "Autumn is always a particular season for me.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Wed2.2": "As a child, I was excited by the numerous monster-related rituals that took place in an attempt to ward off bad omens.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Wed2.3": "How novel they seemed compared to the mundanity of everyday life.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Wed2.4": "As a wizard, however, I spend most of the season both wary of the coming winter and exhausted by my duties as my powers begin to wane.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Wed2.5": "It is not all bad.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Wed2.6": "The crisp fall air makes for a wonderful relief from the summer heat.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Wed2.7": "...Not to mention the wonderful person I am now able to share aspects of my research with.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Thu1.1": "Words can't express how grateful I am for you, @. It is nice to be able to talk with someone about all the aspects of my work.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Int.Fall_Thu1.2": "...Amongst other things.",
	"Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Fall_Thu1.2": "You are absolutely brilliant.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Thu2.1": "Are you staying safe, @?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Thu2.2": "I have to admit, I've grown a little protective of you. Perhaps I'll put together a charmed amulet of defence.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Thu2.3": "It's up to you if you want to wear it, of course.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Fri1.1": "I have been focusing my energies lately to find the answer to this question: how is it that when I'm out and about I'm tired, but when I try to sleep, I cannot?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Fri1.2": "It is a grand mystery, @. Someday I will solve it. First with sheep-counting.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Fri1.3": "So many sheep...",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Fri2.1": "What are your plans for the weekend, @?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Fri2.2": "I am considering inviting you out to forage in the forest. Rare mushrooms are very abundant in the ruins behind my tower this time of year.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Sat1.1": "Your crops, how have they fared? It is my hope that they are doing well.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Sat1.2": "You deserve greatness, @. It is my hope you find it, for I believe it is close at hand for you.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Sat1.3": "If not, then, I have failed you.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Sat2.1": "There are days I wake in my tower where I convince myself that our relationship is some sort of delusion I had conjured amidst the shifting energies of fall.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Sat2.2": "...And then you appear at my doorstep and everything is wonderful once again.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Sat2.3": "You hold a very dear position in this old wizard's heart, @. Thank you for choosing me.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Sun1.1": "It is difficult to remember what it is to have normal conversations. When conversing with the energies, one must speak a unique and complex language.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Sun1.2": "To talk human is to ask how another is and to do that with meaning is hard for me. Luckily, I can practice on you.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Sun1.3": "What's up, dog? No? Is that not a saying?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Sun2.1": "We should take a trip together into the forest soon, @...",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Sun2.2": "There are all kinds of secret places I'd like to show you.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Fall_Sun3.1": "...Hmm? Stay at the tower overnight?",
  "Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Fall_Sun3.2": "I, um...",
  "Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Fall_Sun3.3": "...Thank you for the offer, @, but I will have to refrain for now.",
  "Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Fall_Sun3.4": "...I did not expect you to be so bold, however.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Int.Fall_Sun3.2": "I never took you for such a bold person, @! To ask me in such a direct way while it is still bright outside!",
  "Dating.Wizard.Int.Fall_Sun3.3": "Joking aside, I am always willing to accept you with open arms, my love.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Int.Fall_Sun3.4": "Too busy? Nonsense! I have all the time in the world for you, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Earring.1": "Hmmm, my earrings?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Earring.2": "Are you curious about them?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Earring.3": "You know I am not one for adorning myself in flashy trinkets. In truth, they are my personal artifacts.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Earring.4": "One is specialized in defence while the other offence. They are tuned to my soul alone, so only am I able to access their true strength.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Earring.5": "The majority of older generation practitioners have something similar on their person, but rarely is there a need to call for it forth in its true form.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Earring.6": "Did you think all artifacts were found?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Earring.7": "Someone must have created them at one time, no?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Earring.8": "I will not deny that they are indeed very old, however. I have made many improvements over the long years.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Earring.9": "Why did you make them?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Earring.10": "Like what?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Appearance.1": "...I must ask, my appearance is very strange, is it not?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Appearance.2": "I do not imagine you meet many people with such particular features.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Appearance.3": "Similar to the hue of my hair, my flesh and bones themselves have been altered by my immersion in the energies over the centuries, resulting in what you see today.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Appearance.4": "Considering we have made it thus far, I assume that you do not mind, but I would not blame you for liking someone more 'normal'...",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Appearance.5": "I like it!",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Appearance.6": "Well...",
	"Dating.Wizard.Fall_26.1": "Hello, @. Today I am tasked with assisting with the setting up for the festivities in town.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Fall_26.2": "I shall be busy all day, but it is great to see you nonetheless.",

  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_2.1": "...Ah, @. It's good to see you. Please give me a moment. I'm a little...",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_2.2": "Perhaps we should speak another day. I'm in need of some time alone.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_2.3": "I love you, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_2.4": "That's all I want to say right now.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Wife.1": "First, I want to apologize for yesterday.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Wife.2": "It's often around this time of year I find my thoughts drifting to unproductive topics.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Wife.3": "Part of it is the slowing of my research with the waning of my powers for certain, but our relationship has put certain things into perspective.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Wife.4": "...My ex-wife for example. ",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Wife.EX": "She has long become unrecognizable from who she once was, her madness bringing with it chaos in the valley, but she dominates my regrets so...",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Wife.5": "Of course, I won't subject you to an old man's morose ramblings about lost love without permission.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Wife.6": "Please tell me.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Wife.7": "I don't want to hear about it...",
  "Dating.Wizard.A.Wife.1": "We had similar interests, my ex-wife and I. We would spend hours in each other's arms, reading forbidden books.",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Wife.2": "I proposed to her under the full summer moon.",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Wife.3": "It was...enchanting.",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Wife.4": "That was a very long time ago.",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Wife.5": "In the end, what we couldn't decide on was how to live, our ideals clashing at every turn.",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Wife.6": "I'm afraid to admit just how much time I'd trapped myself in clinging to those brighter days prior to the last year spent with you, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Wife.7": "As presumptuous as it is to say, I feel like I failed her.",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Wife.8": "I let things lapse, I avoided responsibility and it cost me.",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Wife.9": "The details will have to wait for another day, but I don't plan to repeat those failures.",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Wife.10": "...Especially not after you've gone so far to accept me into your life.",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Wife.11": "It is a dangerous compulsion to wonder about how things could have been.",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Wife.12": "If I'd said things differently, if I'd been more understanding...",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Wife.13": "Such thoughts can destroy a person.",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Wife.14": "It's better to always do what you feel is right so you have no regrets. Doing what you feel is wrong, but doing it anyway, is madness.",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Wife.15": "However, what is right is not always concrete nor simple.",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Wife.16": "I hope you're never put in a similar situation.",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Wife.17": "May those be the sole nuggets of wisdom you take from this sad old man's ramblings.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_4.1": "I am still processing through my thoughts.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_4.2": "It is good to see you nonetheless, @.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_4.3": "Come, sit with me for a while. Stories of your day would be a welcome distraction.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_5.1": "...Why have I been in a reflective mood, lately?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_5.2": "Sorry, am I making you jealous?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_5.3": "I'm only joking, of course.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_5.4": "Still, I cannot bring myself to lie to you, @.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_5.5": "Lately, I have had troubled dreams.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_5.6": "In one I meet the children I've never had.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_5.7": "They ask about me, where I have been, what I have done.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_5.8": "Why hadn't I made it work somehow? Isn't it entirely my fault that they do not exist?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_5.9": "To question oneself is natural, yet this goes well and beyond...",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_5.10": "Sometimes, I dream that I am fighting a version of myself that has only existed in theory.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_5.11": "It is an evil version, where all my desires were realized and have driven him mad. He tries to get out and each night, I stop him.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_5.12": "I feel as if I'm about to go mad, myself!",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_5.13": "Only in your presence does the ache seem to soothe, yet I must resist my need to cling to you like a man lost at sea.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_5.14": "You are a beautiful person, @. I do not wish to chain you to myself as a crutch for me to keep walking this path like that man in my dreams.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_5.15": "I thought by exploring the emotions I'd kept sealed I would finally loosen the knot while sating your curiosity, but I only find myself sinking deeper into a mire.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_5.16": "Forgive me for being weak, @.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_5.17": "Your presence offers me great comfort, but this is something I must resolve on my own, least I cling to you as my lifesaving raft for the rest of eternity.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_6.1": "I feel somewhat better today.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_6.2": "Perhaps what I truly needed was to get that off my chest, as the modern vernacular goes.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_6.3": "Have you ever wondered how I came to this path in life?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_6.4": "It is a rather long story so I'll save that for another day, but I originally learned the arts in memory of my mother.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_6.5": "...She was very sick and I had failed to find a means to save her.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_6.6": "My master took pity after hearing my story, found my potential adequate for passing on his specialty as his last act in this world and... here we are.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_6.7": "Yes, it truly is as simple as that. ",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_6.8": "Quite different from how it is today with the Ministry overseeing much of apprentice-master pairings today.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_6.9": "We are still able to personally select an apprentice, but it is a privilege largely only afforded to senior magicians.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_6.10": "Luckily, I am one of the Ministry's founding members.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_8.1": "Hmm? Are you curious about my personal artifacts again? ",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_8.2": "Ah, such things are rare in the current generation of magicians.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_8.3": "It is far more common for artifacts to be passed from masters to apprentices or older rediscovered articles to be refurbished or recycled.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_8.4": "The Elemental Wars produced a surplus in things so not many still study the art of creating new ones.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_8.5": "Modern enchantment runes are founded in the practice, however, hence the occasional visitor to my tower seeking enchantments.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_8.6": "I still enjoy occasionally tinkering, however.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_8.7": "It is something different to do.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_9.1": "I once longed to go back to the days of my youth for one more day. Go into the shop I always put off, talk to the librarians, learn even more.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_9.2": "While I still mourn what was lost, I find myself searching the future more often as our time together grows.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_9.3": "I won't lie. The current world is somewhat confounding to me, @.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_9.4": "I've done what I can to navigate it, but with grace?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_9.5": "...You witnessed enough to know the answer to that.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_9.6": "Some days I feel like an ancient fossil, as somewhat fitting for someone with an age likely approaching four digits.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_9.7": "I've attempted to pick up a number of more modern hobbies for certain, but the era would have already gone by the time I truly manage to integrate myself into it.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_9.8": "That's part of why I find you so mysterious, @.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_9.9": "By all counts you belong to this modern world yet you seem drawn to our near stagnant one.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_9.10": "Not that magic isn't enchanting-- often literally, of course, but not many take to it as you have.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_9.11": "Perhaps, that's why the spirits took such an interest in you to begin with.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_9.12": "Frankly, I feel nothing but appreciation for where things fell. I would not have been able to meet you otherwise.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_10.1": "More stories of my youth?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_10.2": "I may have mentioned it before, but one of the things I did when I was younger was hunt and fight evil beings and creatures. I've encountered them all.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_10.3": "There are beings in this world who still fight wars, the point of which long forgotten, replaced only with hatred of the enemy.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_10.4": "It is a tiring life and I got out of it.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_10.5": "I hope you do not fall into a similar trap as I, with little more than scars to show for it.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_10.6": "Seeing the Order's interest in you, I will assist in whatever matters you wish for me to.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_10.7": "It may be difficult to believe considering my current lifestyle, but I was once one of the more capable in combat, my powers carefully attuned to the ebb and flow of battle.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_10.8": "Please don't be afraid to depend on me, @.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Q.Age.1": "...I must ask, @. Do you not mind my age?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Age.2": "Many mortals have difficulty conceptualizing exactly how long a thousand years is.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Age.3": "Even I myself sometimes fail to comprehend how long I have lived.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Age.4": "...To put things into perspective, when I was a child, the concept of using hops to craft alcohol was a novel new concept.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Age.5": "That is somewhat abstract, isn't it?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Age.6": "Ah, modern historians often categorize periods of time, do they not?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Age.7": "...I believe the era I was born is considered the 'early middle ages'...?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Age.8": "Wow! You must have a lot of stories!",
	"Dating.Wizard.Q.Age.9": "You're that old!?",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Age_Like.1": "Indeed I do!",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Age_Like.2": "Much of them I cannot share in detail due to their magical nature, but I have wandered much of this plane.",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Age_Like.3": "Many of those places have been lost to time since...",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Age_Like.4": "...But I digress. I am glad that it does not seem to bother you, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Age_Eh.1": "Indeed. I am positively ancient.",
	"Dating.Wizard.A.Age_Eh.2": "My hope is that it does not cause too much friction between us, but you are aware of how behind the times I am.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_14.1": "Hmm? How long is a wizard's lifespan?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_14.2": "Ah, are you still thinking of the conversation we had yesterday?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_14.3": "Frankly, I do not know.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_14.4": "Is it odd to not know one's lifespan?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_14.5": "The truth of the matter is that it varies between each magic practitioner and their field of expertise.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_14.6": "Mine in particular has afforded me to be what I'd suspect to be near limitless, as unlikely as that sounds.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_14.7": "I will be honest with you, @, I did not expect to last this long, and sometimes I wonder what I've done right.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_14.8": "Many people who lead this life give in to temptation, go too far, or simply lose the will to continue living as my Master did. It amazes me that I have not.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_14.9": "Perhaps, my ex-wife was correct about my personality in some regard.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_14.10": "No matter how dire, I find myself still able to maintain relative rationality through whatever fate has decided to rain upon me.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_14.11": "The day I am cut loose...",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_14.12": "...Not even I could predict the result, but I imagine it could be quite the problem for the Ministry.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_14.13": "Why do some practitioners look older if I'm as I am after nearly a millennium?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_14.14": "Some of it I'm sure is simply preference, but often those that deal with more simplistic charms have a constitution closer to that of mortals.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_14.15": "A general rule is that the more powerful the magic user, the longer their lives tend to be when excluding outstanding circumstances.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_14.16": "Does that mean I'm a particularly powerful wizard?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_14.17": "I would not have been put in charge of protecting the valley if I wasn't.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_14.18": "Even if I fall short when it comes to raw power in my current state, I am far more experienced at finessing together solutions compared to my younger colleagues.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_15.1": "...I wish I could reveal my true name to you, @. In truth, I just don't remember it.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_15.2": "Was it Carl? Or Hank? Maybe John?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_15.3": "I think it was a good name. It's hard to know.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_15.4": "Maybe it was @! Imagine that?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_15.5": "Yes, Magnus Rasmodius is not, in fact, my real name.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_15.6": "I made it as an alias upon beginning my magic practice, but with time, eventually I and everyone around me forgot my original name.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_15.7": "What is it, do you not like Rasmodius? Weren't you planning on taking it?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_15.8": "Only joking, of course.",
	"Dating.Wizard.BDaySaw_1": "What? No rushed and poorly conceived of party for me?",
	"Dating.Wizard.BDaySaw_2": "I would appear to be a better partner than I originally believed.",
	"Dating.Wizard.BDaySaw_3": "Jests aside, I am too old to partake in such celebrations for the sake of adding to a number I don't even recall.",
	"Dating.Wizard.BDayNo_1": "It is good to see you, @! Hmm? Oh? My birthday?",
	"Dating.Wizard.BDayNo_2": "Ah. Yes, it is indeed my birthday today.",
	"Dating.Wizard.BDayNo_3": "Please do not worry, my love. I have passed far too many of these days to even consider wanting celebrations.",
	"Dating.Wizard.WinterBDay_4": "Having you here to spend time with me is enough.",
	"Dating.Wizard.WinterBDay_5": "If you insist, however, how about visiting the night market tonight?",
	"Dating.Wizard.WinterBDay_6": "I rarely take interest in such frivolous displays, but prior trips have been fruitful in the discovery of useful reagents.",
	"Dating.Wizard.WinterBDay_7": "Perhaps we could even make it a... what do you call it... a date?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_21.1": "Yet another day we inch towards spring.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_21.2": "I can already feel my powers expanding once more, but it'll be still some time until I feel completely like myself.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_21.3": "What are your plans for the coming year, @?#$b#I assume you'll be expanding your farm operations?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Mon1.1": "Oftentimes I am compelled to reflect on my own origins during winter.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Mon1.2": "While I may have met my master the following spring, it was my determination to power through the harsh winter that drew his attention.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Mon1.3": "...How long ago that was.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Mon2.1": "I am trying to keep positive, but it is very difficult this time of year.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Mon2.2": "However, you are here now. It is always a good thing when you make the time to visit me.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Tue1.1": "I must admit, you are proving a very good distraction to my usual winter night terrors.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Tue1.2": "They still occur, but they are much easier to cope with now that you are here, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Tue1.3": "...Ah... 'What if you stayed over'?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Int.Winter_Tue1.4": "...It is true that I do indeed sleep much better when you are with me, but I cannot impose such a selfish request on you, my love.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Int.Winter_Tue1.5": "If you were do to so of your own volition, however, I will not stop you.",
	"Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Winter_Tue1.3": "...Ah... 'What if you stayed over'?",
	"Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Winter_Tue1.4": "...I would not want to impose on you in such a manner, @. Not for simply a few nightmares, at least...",
	"Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Winter_Tue1.5": "Thank you for the offer, however. You do not know how reassuring it is to know that you are willing to go so above and beyond for my sake.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Tue2.1": "I am always happy to spend time with you, @. It's great seeing you.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Tue2.2": "How is the farm? How are you keeping busy this season? Tell me everything.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Tue2.3": "Every day is a good day when @ shows up.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Wed1.1": "It is my hope that our conversations have inspired you in some way, as you have inspired me.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Wed1.2": "Together we are stronger than being alone, and for that, thank you.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Wed1.3": "Who knows? If we hadn't met, I'd just talk to myself.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Wed1.4": "...It is better than the specters of regret, at least.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Wed2.1": "Are you cold? I can't imagine it was easy running all the way here in the middle of winter.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Wed2.2": "Feel free to warm up by the fire.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Int.Winter_Wed2.3": "Or, we could...",
	"Dating.Wizard.Int.Winter_Wed2.4": "Ahem, nothing.",
	"Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Winter_Wed2.3": "...Or... maybe we could cuddle a little?",
	"Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Winter_Wed2.4": "Merely a suggestion, of course.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Thu1.1": "Learning and studying have been my focus for such a long time, I've forgotten how old I actually am.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Thu1.2": "In a way, it is a miracle I still remember the date of my birth, let alone the year.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Thu2.1": "I once lamented that my appearance was not one fitting of my true age.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Thu2.2": "It is not as if there are many humans who live beyond a century, but there are benefits to fitting the archetype of an 'elder'.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Thu2.3": "Adventurers would be less inclined to act familiar with me, in the least.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Thu2.4": "However, in light of our relationship, I am thankful for my deceptive appearance.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Thu2.5": "It would be far more awkward if I appeared to be a white-haired sage with a very long beard!",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Fri1.1": "Often, I lamented the coming of the winter season, yet this year I cannot help but think how the weather will push you to linger in my tower for just that moment longer.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Fri1.2": "You have reminded me that I am still human. To focus on being human is a mystery itself that I almost forgot about.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Fri2.1": "It is strange how much a little companionship can impact one's view of a season. ",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Fri2.2": "I cannot express how grateful I am for your presence here, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Fri2.3": "I have spent more than one winter lost in my own nightmares and lament over the years.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Fri2.4": "I cannot say I did not lament at all this year, but it is far-flung from my usual misery. ",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Sat1.1": "What a year it has been. I'm glad we have grown so close, @. It would have been very boring without you.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Sat1.2": "Just me and the Shrine of Illusion, making faces at each other.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Sat1.3": "I still make faces at the Shrine. I'm not sure it appreciates it.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Sat2.1": "Are you keeping warm, @?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Sat2.2": "Do not underestimate the cold. It has claimed more lives than one can even begin to imagine.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Sat2.3": "I understand that modern clothing has dramatically advanced over the ages in terms of heat retention, but I cannot help but fret over you nonetheless.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Sun1.1": "Oftentimes, winter leaves me feeling somewhat directionless; the majority of my experiments are difficult to perform in the low temperatures with my lacking energies.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_Sun1.2": "I am glad you are here, @. I would have driven myself mad as I've done almost every year if you did not insist on your visits.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Int.Winter_Sun2.1": "It has been a long time since I knew the pleasure of holding another in my arms, let alone the joy of finding such a brilliant soul.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Int.Winter_Sun2.2": "How I long to embrace you every waking moment, @.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Int.Winter_Sun2.3": "I have a suspicion that may become a new dependency if our relationship were to progress further.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Int.Winter_Sun2.4": "...One I would welcome as well.",
  "Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Winter_Sun2.1": "It has been a long time since I've felt so much joy from simply speaking to another.",
  "Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Winter_Sun2.2": "How I await your visits every day, my love.",
  "Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Winter_Sun2.3": "I suspect I may be unable to function without you in a few years at this rate, my love.",
	"Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Winter_Sun2.4": "Somehow, that speculation brings me more joy than dread.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_28.1": "Let us finally say goodbye to this fateful year and hello to many more in the future, @.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Winter_28.2": "Many hold the tradition of setting resolutions for the new year. Us magic folk are no different, but perhaps our tradition holds more in common with a wish than a goal.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_28.3": "Whatever your resolution is, @, I hope it comes true. ",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_28.4": "...My resolution?",
	"Dating.Wizard.Winter_28.5": "I will keep it a secret for now, but I'll tell you if it comes into being.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Ginger_1": "Ah, you've been exploring Ginger Island?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Ginger_2": "I seldom leave the valley these days outside of summons or duties the Order has issued, but I've visited that particular island in the past.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Ginger_3": "I remember it being a rather tropical location.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Ginger_4": "Combined with the constant rain, it didn't quite agree with my usual dress sense so I ended that trip with not much on outside of my underclothes.",
  "Dating.Wizard.Ginger_5": "Would I like to visit again?",
  "Dating.Wizard.Int.Ginger_6": "@, this isn't a veiled attempt to convince me to strip down, is it? ",
  "Dating.Wizard.Int.Ginger_7": "If that is your goal, you should know I need far less convincing than such a convoluted reason.",
  "Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Ginger_6": "@, this isn't a veiled attempt to tease me, is it? ",
  "Dating.Wizard.NoInt.Ginger_7": "If that is your goal, there is far less you could do to best me.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Ginger_8": "As for your suggestion, I think it's one with merit, but we would need to find the appropriate time for that 'vacation'.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Ginger_9": "Let me ponder it for a season or two.",
	"Dating.Wizard.Ginger_10": "Sorry to disappoint, but I've long since learned a temperature-regulating spell so the robe stays.",
  "Dating.Wizard.CarolineEx1": "...Ah, @, it is good that you are here.",
	 "Dating.Wizard.CarolineEx2": "I wish to speak with you regarding something important.",
  "Dating.Wizard.CarolineEx3": "...I had been considering how to breach the topic with you, for some time, but better to simply come forward than delay it any longer...",
  "Dating.Wizard.CarolineEx4": "...Yes, it is about Caroline and Abigail.",
  "Dating.Wizard.CarolineEx5": "I won't mince words, I once had feelings for Caroline, yet she only saw me as the mysterious man living in the tower she could vent to.",
  "Dating.Wizard.CarolineEx6": "It has been over two decades, but I still remember that night. ",
  "Dating.Wizard.CarolineEx7": "Her significant other had committed an injustice towards her and she came to me for support during their fallout.",
  "Dating.Wizard.CarolineEx8": "Perhaps she was feeling vengeful, or it was a mere moment of weakness, but that day went beyond the comforts of a friend.",
  "Dating.Wizard.CarolineEx9": "She regretted it immediately after and we never spoke again.",
  "Dating.Wizard.CarolineEx10": "Later, I learned that she had married that man and birthed a child who suspiciously bore some of my features.",
  "Dating.Wizard.CarolineEx11": "Yes, it was Abigail.",
  "Dating.Wizard.CarolineEx12": "...My plans?",
  "Dating.Wizard.CarolineEx13": "You are mistaken, @. I have no plans in regards to Abigail.",
  "Dating.Wizard.CarolineEx14": "I've noticed her interesting interest in combat and minor talent in the arts, but I am content to stay my tongue for the sake of things remaining as they are.",
  "Dating.Wizard.CarolineEx15": "I simply felt that it was imperative you knew the truth least you be dragged into this mess should it come to the surface.",
  "Dating.Wizard.CarolineEx16": "...I understand if you see less of me because of it.",
  "Dating.Wizard.CarolineEx17": "I share part of the fault, after all.",
  "Dating.Wizard.CarolineEx18": "You're almost a thousand years old! How could she have fooled you?",
  "Dating.Wizard.CarolineEx19": "It's not your fault she took advantage of you.",

	//Happy Birthday Compat.
  "Dating.Wizard.FBirthday1": "I am still making preparation for tonight, @.",
  "Dating.Wizard.FBirthday2": "I cannot promise it will be spectacular considering the limited time I have access, but I will do whatever I can to make it a positive experience for you.",
  "Dating.Wizard.FBirthday3": "You should make sure to complete all your tasks for the day, however.",
  "Dating.Wizard.FBirthday4": "I would not want you toiling away in the middle of the night afterwards.",
  "Dating.Wizard.FBirthday5": "Ah, before I forget, please take this.",
  "Dating.Wizard.FBirthday6": "I thought of you immediately when I found it in tower storage.",
  "Dating.Wizard.FBirthday7": "I recall there being fascinating pillars in the desert that are said to grant individuals with a fragment of the galaxy should they offer a rainbow forged by land.",
	"Dating.Wizard.FBirthday8": "Why not try it out for yourself if you have not already?",
	"Dating.Wizard.FBirthday9": "I shall see you tonight, my love.",

//Engagement Dialogue
  "Engagement.Wizard.1.1": "Words cannot express what it means to me to join hands with you.",
  "Engagement.Wizard.1.2": "Were you planning this all along?",
  "Engagement.Wizard.1.3": "I thought you had no interest towards marriage at this moment considering we'd finally found some stability in our relationship...",
  "Engagement.Wizard.1.4": "...But to think you too wished for us to truly join!",
  "Engagement.Wizard.1.5": "I never dared to imagine there would be such a day.",
  "Engagement.Wizard.2.1": "Preparations are underway, @!",
  "Engagement.Wizard.2.2": "Have you been sleeping? Because I haven't.",
  "Engagement.Wizard.2.3": "When I close my eyes, I see us standing at the altar, the life we will have laid before us.",
  "Engagement.Wizard.2.4": "Don't worry. I'll make sure to force myself to rest with a draught before the big day.",
  "Engagement.Wizard.3.1": "I must admit, communicating my desires for our wedding with the town has been... a challenge.",
  "Engagement.Wizard.3.2": "Lewis looked as if his eyes were about to depart his head when I announced the news to him.",
  "Engagement.Wizard.3.3": "Worry not, my love.",
  "Engagement.Wizard.3.4": "I will make up for any insufficiencies caused by my poor communication skills with magic.",
  "Engagement.Wizard.3.5": "I do not enjoy supplementing my energies with mana elixirs, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime event!",
  "Engagement.Wizard.4.1": " I will not lie, @. Part of me is afraid things will fall apart once more.",
  "Engagement.Wizard.4.2": "Perhaps not nearly as dramatically considering the vastly different circumstances, but the heart often fails to grasp logic beyond pain.",
  "Engagement.Wizard.4.3": "But, I believe in us, @. I know we can make it work.",

"Dating.GiftReaction_Solar_Essence": "Ah, solar essence.${{e1}}#$b#It is quite fascinating how such energies often come from creatures commonly considered 'undead', is it not?${{e3}}#$b#Perhaps it is a crystallization of what remained of 'life' trapped within a void-filled shell.${{e3}}#$b#Still, such essences are incredibly useful for my studies.

"Dating.GiftReaction_Ghostfish": "Ah, have you brought something interesting from the mines? ${{e9}}#$b#Ah, yes, this is a ghostfish. Unlike the other findings, it is quite mundane, I assure you.${{e3}}#$b#They exist in the sphere of the underground still largely dominated by mana, thus their unique features are merely the result of evolving under low-light conditions.${{e0}}#$b#...What is strange is the preference ghosts hold for them...${{e3}}#$b#Perhaps that in itself speaks to their oddity.${{e0}}",

"Dating.GiftReaction_Void_Mayonnaise": "Ah, a favourite spread for void creatures.${{e9}}#$b#We humans are mana-born creatures so the closest we shall get to appreciating a void dish would be the heavily processed void delight and void sushis, but this is a true delicacy amongst the void-born.${{e9}}#$b#Simply ask our friend in the sewers if you are curious.${{e9}}",
"Dating.GiftReaction_Goldenfish": "I can think of two places in the valley with such fauna and they are both rather difficult to reach.${{e8}}#$b#I knew your connection with nature was great, but not to such a degree, my love.${{e6}}#$b#It is no wonder I was so drawn to you....${{e4}}",
"Dating.GiftReaction_Slime_Berry": "Ah, is this one of the monster crop the battle wizard from First Slash was inquiring about?${{e3}}#$b#Quite the curious berry indeed...${{e3}}#$b#I can see its monstrous features, but it is still far too early to understand and why these seeds came about.${{e0}}#$b#Still, thank you for the sample, my heart. ${{e6}}#$b#...Just give me a moment to find a good container for it and to wash my hands.....${{e3}}",

"Dating.GiftReaction_Monster_Mushroom": "What a very curious mushroom indeed...${{e3}}#$b#I assume it is one of the monster crop, yes?

"Dating.GiftReaction_Monster_Fruit": "....Never in my life did I expect to feel as if a nonsentient plant was staring at me....${{e5}}#$b#Yes, I realize it is just a pattern, but it is somewhat unsettling nonetheless.${{e3}}#$b#I assume this is another one of the monster crop?${{e0}}#$b#...It tastes like a stardrop?${{e7}}#$b#I am not sure to be surprised that you have eaten a stardrop or that you casually could eat one of these and compare the flavours....${{e7}}",

"Married.GiftReaction_Mixed_Berry_Pie": "Ah! Another slice of fruit pie.${{e6}}#$b#Frankly, I find it very interesting how pies in this region of the world have largely trended towards dessert than the savoury entire meals from my time as a mortal.${{e9}}#$b#I cannot say whether it is a trend I am in favour of, but every example you've presented me has been excellent without contest.${{e1}}#$b#I merely hope you will continue to be willing to split a pie with me, no matter it be savoury or sweet.${{e4}}",

I should be careful with today's offering?${{e7}}#$b#Ah, yes, this dish.${{e9}}#$b#It is quite intriguing, no?${{e1}}#$b#Through the careful introduction of limited poisons, the body pushes itself to act, allowing warriors to stretch their limits at the cost of stamina.${{e9}}#$b#I have eaten more than a few while preparing for certain battles, but I doubt there will be any foes to face within my tower.${{e6}}#$b#Thank you nonetheless, my love. I think I will simply study it rather than eat it, however.${{e9}}",
"Married.GiftReaction_Seaweed_Salad": "Ah, a simplistic seaweed salad, I see.${{e1}}#$b#How you have managed to turn even something as common as seaweed into a delectable side dish is a miracle in itself, frankly.${{e3}}#$b#Even I had trouble downing the travesty that was 'emergency seaweed dinner' from my adventuring days.${{e5}}",

"HairBlock_MidCut.6": "To be completely honest with you, my heart, I am almost a little relieved that you decided to cut it back to this length.${{e0}}#$b#I had never realized the dedication it took to maintain one's hair in pristine condition at such a length until I experienced it myself.${{e7}}#$b#It was worth the effort to impress you, however, so do not hesitate to ask me to grow it out again if that is what you desire.${{e4}}",

//Long Loose

"HairBlock_LongLoose.0": "You wish to tidy the shape up so I may wear it loose?${{e7}}#$b#Frankly, I am always puzzled by your use of 'tidy up' and 'shape' in this context, but the result is always better than anticipated.${{e1}}#$b#Do what you will, my love. I trust you completely.${{e6}}#$b#That said, allow me a moment to cast the pre-emptive clean up spells.${{e9}}",
"HairBlock_LongLoose.1": "Once again you have somehow managed to perform a miracle.${{e8}}",
"HairBlock_LongLoose.2": "I attempted to find some semblance of order to your method, but I find myself woefully lost.${{e3}}#$b#How do you determine what should be trimmed or thinned and what shouldn't?${{e3}}",
"HairBlock_LongLoose.3": "You 'make it up as you go'...?${{e7}}#$b#Truly, you are a farmer of many talents.${{e8}}^Truly, you are a woman of many talents.${{e8}}#$b#How did this old wizard ever manage to win your heart?${{e6}}",
"HairBlock_LongLoose.4": "I suppose I will simply have to put in more effort to make sure you receive the love and admiration you are due.${{e4}}",
"HairBlock_LongLoose.5": "I had thought that resisting the urge to flip my hair while it was mid-length was difficult, but now?${{e7}}#$b#I may almost go as far as to say it is fun, in a strange, satisfying sort of way.${{e1}}#$e#Let us keep that little fact a secret between us.${{e4}}#$b#I'd like to keep my reputation in the Ministry as a dignified elder, if possible.${{e6}}#$b#...Plus, I grew out my hair for you to enjoy.${{e9}}#$b#Why should I share the fun of employing a 'dramatic flip' with anyone else?${{e4}}",

//Long Pony
"HairBlock_LongPony.0": "A ponytail, you say?${{e7}}#$b#It is rather long for that, isn't it?${{e7}}",
"HairBlock_LongPony.1": "...'That's the whole point'...?${{e7}}#$b#I'm afraid that I will have to see once you are done, my love.${{e6}}#$b#Until then, I will surrender myself to your mercy.${{e4}}",
"HairBlock_LongPony.2": "...I must admit, there is something captivating about having my hair styled like this.${{e1}}#$b#The way it sways whenever I turn my head will take some getting used to, however.${{e7}}",
"HairBlock_LongPony.3": "Ah, that swaying is what you were after, is it?${{e1}}#$b#I suppose I can carry a tiny inconvenience for the sake of entertaining the love of my life.${{e6}}#$b#Though, I suppose I should be thanking you instead for helping me draw in your attention.${{e4}}",
"HairBlock_LongPony.4": "I know I called it an inconvenience a moment before, but now that I have walked around a little, I think I agree with you.${{e7}}#$b#The swaying *is* rather 'fun'.${{e1}}#$b#Hopefully, more for you than me. I would not want to spend hours of the day just swaying it back and forth.${{e6}}",

//Long Tail
"HairBlock_LongTail.0": "I have no objections in regards to the hairstyle itself, but a ribbon?${{e7}}#$b#...Would that not be a little too 'cute' for an adult man?${{e2}}",
"HairBlock_LongTail.1": "...I suppose I did give you complete reign to do as you like.${{e8}}#$b#Alright, my love.${{e6}}#$b#I shall trust in your judgment.${{e4}}",
"HairBlock_LongTail.2": "Ah, the ribbon is indeed rather prominent, isn't it?${{e7}}#$b#I'm certain a few someones will have a comment or two when they see it.${{e10}}",
"HairBlock_LongTail.3": "Do not worry, my love. As long as you favour it, it shall remain.${{e6}}#$b#A bit of teasing is nothing compared to making you happy.${{e4}}",
"HairBlock_LongTail.4": "I spent a little more time studying the style in the mirror after we'd cleaned up.${{e3}}#$b#Frankly, the more I look at it, the more I find myself embracing the ribbon, bow and all.${{e6}}#$b#It certainly does add a more 'friendly' air to my appearance compared to usual.${{e9}}",

//Long Braid
"HairBlock_LongBraid.0": "A single long braid?${{e7}}#$b#I suppose I'd never considered such a style for myself.${{e0}}#$b#Back in my youth, it was sometimes seen amongst certain nobility, but not often.${{e3}}#$b#After all, it is not practical to wear one's hair too long when one must don armour frequently to combat monstrous threats.${{e9}}#$b#The same did not apply to practitioners, however.${{e0}}#$b#After all, why would a Wizard wear cumbersome artifacts over enchanted garments?${{e1}}#$b#Still, I see no reason not to try my hair in a braid.${{e9}}#$b#I'm sure the result will be spectacular considering it is by your hand.${{e4}}",
"HairBlock_LongBraid.1": "It had never occurred to me that I had quite so much... volume until I see gathered and braided like this.${{e7}}",
"HairBlock_LongBraid.2": "Still, I can see why you suggested it, @.${{e9}}#$b#It has a certain rustic quality to it juxtaposed with the modern era.${{e1}}#$b#Thank you again, my love.${{e6}}#$b#Never in another thousand years would I have considered something like this without your encouragement.${{e6}}",
"HairBlock_LongBraid.3": "Frankly, I'd never considered my image so flexible before we began this endeavour.${{e9}}#$b#I'd originally proposed it in an attempt to make you happy, but I find myself enjoying this far more than even I'd predicted.${{e8}}",

//Long Neat
"HairBlock_LongNeat.0": "...With 'flourish', you say?${{e7}}#$b#I'm afraid I do not quite understand what that entails.${{e7}}",
"HairBlock_LongNeat.1": "'Like maybe a braid or two'...?${{e3}}#$b#I think I will simply have to trust that you are aware of what you're doing, my love.${{e0}}#$b#I'm certain the result will be very impressive.${{e6}}",
"HairBlock_LongNeat.2": "Ah! So that is what you meant!${{e6}}",
"HairBlock_LongNeat.3": "I am always impressed with your work. This instance is no exception.${{e6}}#$b#I've seen others in the community attempt to successfully mimic a similar style, but I have yet to see one executed so brilliantly.${{e1}}",
"HairBlock_LongNeat.4": "Yes, I am aware that I am heavily biased, but that is the truth in my eyes, my heart!${{e6}}#$b#Thank you again for all your efforts in making this dull old man look somewhere approaching 'handsome'.${{e4}}",
"HairBlock_LongNeat.5": "I find it quite fascinating how a simple change of hairstyle can dramatically impact a person's image.${{e0}}#$b#What is even more impressive is how you've managed to capture a feeling of 'me' in every choice.${{e8}}#$b#How exceptional your talents are, beloved.${{e6}}",

//Long Bun
"HairBlock_LongBun.0": "You wish to coil it?${{e7}}#$b#Does that not defeat the purpose of growing it to this length to begin with?${{e3}}",
"HairBlock_LongBun.1": "I suppose it would indeed 'keep it out of the way'...${{e0}}#$b#Perhaps this is another instance where I will come to understand once it is complete.${{e3}}#$b#Go ahead and start, my heart.${{e6}}",
"HairBlock_LongBun.2": "Ah.... Very convenient indeed!${{e1}}#$b#I may even suggest it is more 'secure' than when I had my hair cropped short.${{e7}}",
"HairBlock_LongBun.3": "...Although... is it not a little feminine...?${{e3}}#$b#I have certainly never seen another man wear their hair in this manner.${{e3}}",
"HairBlock_LongBun.4": "...'It's charming'? ${{e8}}#$b#...I suppose I have nothing to complain about if that is how you feel, my love.${{e6}}#$b#You are the reason I agreed to this arrangement after all.${{e9}}#$b#How could I deny your opinion?${{e6}}",
"HairBlock_LongBun.5": "Ah, beloved! This new hairstyle is already showing its benefits when I went to dig through the tomes in my office.${{e1}}#$b#It still feels a little odd to have the full weight of my hair concentrated on one point, but I'm sure I will adapt by the end of the day.${{e9}}",

//Cut Short 2
"HairBlock_CutShort2.0": "Ah, cutting it back to short again?${{e9}}#$b#Alright, please give me a moment to set up the spell.${{e1}}",
"HairBlock_CutShort2.1": "Splendid job as always, my love.${{e6}}#$b#How you manage to do what you do so effortlessly will forever be a mystery.${{e6}}",
"HairBlock_CutShort2.2": "You truly are a marvel.${{e4}}",
"HairBlock_CutShort2.3": "It feels a little odd to return to my short hair after having spent the better part of my time growing it out.${{e0}}#$b#Still, I would not mind growing it out again should you change your mind.${{e4}}#$b#After all, I suggested this whole endeavour as a way to spend more time with you.${{e6}}",

//Mid Loose 2
"HairBlock_MidLoose2.0": "Ah, yes, I believe that would be wonderful.${{e1}}#$b#Frankly, I still do not completely understand what it is you actually do, but it always comes out looking far neater.${{e1}}",
"HairBlock_MidLoose2.1": "Ah, amazing work as always, my love.${{e6}}",
"HairBlock_MidLoose2.2": "Frankly this endeavour into changing my hair has really opened my eyes to how stagnant my persona had become over the years.${{e3}}",
"HairBlock_MidLoose2.3": "Thank you for showing me that I can be more than a stuffy old wizard past his prime.${{e6}}#$b#I love you, @.${{e4}}",
"HairBlock_MidLoose2.4": "Ah, I am once again able to freely flip my hair as I like.${{e1}}#$b#I would have expected the novelty to have worn off by now, yet somehow it still remains a satisfying activity.${{e7}}#$b#How odd.${{e6}}",

//Mid Pony 2
"HairBlock_MidPony2.0": "Ah, the short ponytail again, is it?${{e9}}#$b#I found it convenient when we tied it last time so you shall hear no complaints from me.${{e6}}",
"HairBlock_MidPony2.1": "I must admit, I have grown quite fond of the red hair string you often use for tied elements.${{e9}}",
"HairBlock_MidPony2.2": "I feel as if I am carrying a little fragment of you on my person.${{e6}}",
"HairBlock_MidPony2.3": "I love you, my heart.${{e4}}",
"HairBlock_MidPony2.4": "One benefit to this style is that keeps my hair out of the way when I must lean down to complete certain enchantment runes.${{e1}}#$e#What did I do to keep my hair out of the way before?${{e7}}#$b#...It's a little embarrassing to admit, but I often simply just stiffened it with magic beforehand so it would remain in whatever position it was in.${{e3}}",

//Mid Tail 2
"HairBlock_MidTail2.0": "Ah, you're going to do some maintenance and tie it again?${{e9}}#$b#That sounds perfect to me, my heart.${{e1}}",
"HairBlock_MidTail2.1": "Sometimes even I'm surprised at how close I come towards 'dashing' with my hair like this.${{e7}}",
"HairBlock_MidTail2.2": "If that is not proof of your skill, I do not know what is.${{e6}}",
"HairBlock_MidTail2.3": "Thank you, beloved.${{e4}}",
"HairBlock_MidTail2.4": "I cannot express how special of an existence you are, @.${{e4}}#$b#Who else would be so eager and dedicated to making sure I look my best?${{e6}}",

//Grow Mid to Long 2
"HairBlock_MidGrow2.0": "Ah, you wish for me to grow it out once more?${{e7}}",
"HairBlock_MidGrow2.1": "*chuckles* Understood. I will begin immediately.${{e4}}#$b#Let us simply focus on maintenance today like before.${{e6}}",
"HairBlock_MidGrow2.2": "Quite the temporary cleanup, you did, my love.${{e6}}#$b#If I did not know better, I would say this is quite the adequate style in itself.${{e6}}",
"HairBlock_MidGrow2.3": "I should be able to handle the care from here.${{e1}}#$b#A season should be enough to return the desired length.${{e9}}",
"HairBlock_MidGrow2.4": "I won't deny that having very long hair is inconvenient in many ways, but that adoration in your expression is worth more than the world, let alone a minor annoyance or two.${{e4}}",

//Long Loose 2
"HairBlock_LongLoose2.0": "Ah, loose once more, is it?${{e6}}#$b#I know how much you enjoy playing with it when we're alone together.${{e4}}",
"HairBlock_LongLoose2.1": "Go ahead, my love.${{e6}}#$b#I shall remain still while you 'break up the layers' once more.${{e9}}",
"HairBlock_LongLoose2.2": "Neat and tidy as usual.${{e9}}",
"HairBlock_LongLoose2.3": "Now, to convince you to run your hands through it some more before we must part for the morning...${{e4}}",
"HairBlock_LongLoose2.4": "What are your thoughts, my love?${{e6}}",
"HairBlock_LongLoose2.5": "While I may tease a little for your attraction to my hair, I cannot deny that I understand the appeal.${{e1}}#$b#Sometimes I even find myself unconsciously fiddling with a strand or two while deep in thought.${{e7}}",

//Long Pony 2
"HairBlock_LongPony2.0": "Ah, the 'pendulum' again, is it?${{e1}}",
"HairBlock_LongPony2.1": "Alright, please go ahead and prepare. I shall make sure clean up is swift as usual.${{e6}}",
"HairBlock_LongPony2.2": "Ah yes, exactly as it was last time, swaying and all.${{e9}}",
"HairBlock_LongPony2.3": "I recall the motion would hypnotize you whenever you thought I wasn't looking.${{e4}}#$b#How hungry that gaze would be!${{e6}}#$b#I felt as if you were readying to swallow me whole!${{e8}}",
"HairBlock_LongPony2.4": "Only joking, of course.${{e6}}#$b#That said, I did enjoy the additional attention.${{e6}}#$b#I simply wish you would train it on my face instead so I may gaze upon you all the same.${{e4}}",
"HairBlock_LongPony2.5": "I will admit, I did miss the swaying a little when we tried something else.${{e6}}#$b#There is indeed something very satisfying about it.${{e9}}",

//Long Tail 2
"HairBlock_LongTail2.0": "Planning to make your husband 'cute', again, my love?${{e4}}",
"HairBlock_LongTail2.1": "*chuckles* I can never say no to you, my heart.${{e6}}#$b#Go ahead, I shall wear it with pride.${{e4}}",
"HairBlock_LongTail2.2": "Just as charming as before, I see.${{e1}}",
"HairBlock_LongTail2.3": "I still do not completely understand what is appealing about an adult man being 'cute'...${{e3}}#$b#...But I cannot help giving approval when I see the smile on your face.${{e4}}#$b#You are the world to me, @.${{e6}}#$b#A mere ribbon is nothing in comparison.${{e6}}",
"HairBlock_LongTail2.4": "I must admit, the townsfolk do seem somewhat more at ease in my presence when the bow is present.${{e7}}#$b#Something about it seems to suggest an air of approachability.${{e3}}#$b#It is still a little embarrassing when the eyes of adventurers linger on it for a little too long, however.${{e6}}",

//Long Braid 2
"HairBlock_LongBraid2.0": "Ah, shall we condense it into a braid once more?${{e9}}#$b#Please let me know if you need my assistance holding anything in place.${{e9}}",
"HairBlock_LongBraid2.1": "No matter how many times I see it, I am always surprised by the amount of volume this particular style displays.${{e7}}#$b#The ribbon at the end is a nice touch as well.${{e9}}",
"HairBlock_LongBraid2.2": "Thank you again for doing this, my love.${{e1}}#$b#I never would have taken the leap to attempt to experiment with my image if it weren't for your encouragement.${{e4}}",

"HairBlock_LongNeat2.3": "I've recently discovered that similar styles are fairly common amongst depictions of the magical community in mundane art works.${{e7}}#$b#Did the mundane see the trend manifesting on their local practitioner and assumed it was simply how we styled our hair, or was the magical community inspired by the conceptions of the mundane?${{e7}}#$b#Truly, a grand mystery.${{e3}}",

//Long Bun 2
"HairBlock_LongBun2.0": "Ah! You wish to coil it again?${{e9}}#$b#Go ahead, my love.${{e1}}#$b#As much as I enjoy the attention you lavish on to me for these locks, it will be good to not worry about hair accidentally dripping into the cauldron!${{e9}}",

"HairBlock_LongBun2.2": "I do not know how you do it, but the 'bun' always remains secured to the end of the day without issue.${{e7}}#$b#Had I not known better, I would have expected magic was involved.${{e9}}#$b#I suppose that is simply the 'magic' of you, my love.${{e6}}",
"HairBlock_LongBun2.3": "My hair has always had a slight curl but since we began coiling it, they are much more apparent.${{e0}}#$b#I realize that is it not permanent, but it certainly does give me some thoughts in regards to a novel potion idea.${{e9}}#$b#No doubt, it would be less intrusive from that hazardous device you call a 'curling iron'!${{e3}}",


//Adjust Bangs

"SeasonIntro.2": "Indeed, rather than a concoction meant for ingestion, I am working on a type of magical dye today.${{e9}}#$b#Unlike their mundane counterparts, magic dyes are resistant to fading and possess far better magic conductivity.${{e9}}#$b#Such properties make them ideal for use in garments worn by practitioners, but it is usually too cost prohibitive for most casual articles.${{e0}}#$b#The ingredients themselves are nothing too special, but the process is rather mana intensive for most.${{e3}}",
"SeasonIntro.3": "#Sounds tough!#Why make something like this if you're usually saving mana for your experiments?",
"SeasonIntro.4": "Indeed!${{e1}}#$b#I am one of the few individuals who could ever create such a product alone to any degree of success.${{e9}}#$b#Still, I do not do so casually simply because it is valuable and I possess the capacity.${{e3}}",

How could anyone say no?${{e5}}#$b#Yet, magic was not what I thought it was.${{e5}}#$b# Not his magic, at least.${{e3}}#$b# Countless were the rules, gruelling were the studies, painful was it to bridge the planes; all of it for seemingly a highly inefficient way of magic that appeared on the surface to have no boons and all cons.${{e3}}#$b#I felt tricked and betrayed to say the least.${{e9}}#$b#That was what originally pushed me to join the wars, @.${{e3}}#$b#I sought to break free of my Master and pave my own path.${{e5}}#$b#Why would I follow his when it had even driven him to seek the end?${{e3}}",
"First.LibraryDate.17": "...But I was wrong.${{e3}}#$b#All the fighting did was break my soul further.${{e2}}#$b#In a sense, I proved my Master's judgment correct.${{e3}}#$b#I wielded the energies far better than he ever did, laying waste to countless with seemingly a mere snap of my fingers.${{e3}}#$b#But it terrified me, @.${{e2}}#$b#I may joke at times about giving you the world, but back then, I truly felt I could have it.${{e3}}#$b#Like a poison sinking into my bones, I hated that I'd become the kind of person who didn't flinch at destroying hundreds, but at the same time a part of me relished at being the reaper; taking control over the lives of so many, my whims dictating their continued existence.${{e5}}#$b#Camilla may joke that I'm a walking calamity waiting to happen, but back then, that was exactly what I was.${{e5}}#$b#...A monster.${{e2}}",

Me?#$b#I would not go as far as to call it a 'preference', my love, but a person picks up a lot of odd ideas while travelling.${{e9}}#$b#I thought it would be fun to do something a little different than usual.${{e6}}#$b#Clearly, my intuition was correct considering how immersed you were soon after beginning.${{e4}}#$e#Call me a lewd old man all you like.${{e6}}#$b#You were the one who indulged me.${{e6}}#$b#...And you were also the one who was begging for more near the end, my heart.${{e4}}^...And you were also the one who was begging for more near the end, my sweet princess.${{e4}}",
"Date.Picnic.Later_forest.16": "What role does mana play in all that?#$b#That is a rather complex question, my love.${{e1}}#$b#The cycles of our world and life have foundations in both science and magic.${{e9}}#$b#It is only recently that humanity has begun to understand the former and the latter is still a mystery to even those of us who practice it.${{e1}}#$b#In a sense, magic can too, be boiled down to formulas and calculations, but its components are far more abstract.${{e3}}#$b#In a sense, much of modern magic is an attempt to standardize that abstraction as science has been among the mundane.${{e9}}#$b#I cannot deny its effectiveness at passing along information and producing consistent effects, but such a structured framework also places limitations where there were none before.${{e3}}#$b#Thus, it isn't uncommon to find more experienced practitioners drifting back to relearn older models of magic even if they are oftentimes less practical in use.${{e1}}#$b#I have also heard inklings of attempts to combine science and magic in their entirety.${{e1}}#$b#I would be happy to share such discoveries with you as they arise.${{e9}}",

"Date.Picnic.Later_forest.18": "Magnus and I spent the rest of the afternoon strolling along the river...",

"Date.Picnic.Later_forest.22": "Have I been to the Calico desert?#$b#Why of course, I have, my love.${{e1}}#$b#Somewhat recently, in fact.${{e3}}#$b#Recently for a wizard at least.${{e1}}#$b#I believe the last time I inspected the seals was around a century ago.${{e3}}",

"Date.Picnic.Later_forest.24": "...What happened?${{e3}}#$b#That is... quite the complicated story, I'm afraid.${{e3}}#$b#Sadly, it is not what I would call a happy one either.${{e2}}",
"Date.Picnic.Later_forest.25": "What was called the Calico deserts once stretched for more north than it does today, much of the lands since engulfed by the cloud of void energies that haunt Galdora.${{e3}}#$b#We have been making a great effort to contain the spread of the void domain, but accidents are bound to occur from time to time.${{e2}}#$b#We are only human after all.${{e3}}",
"Date.Picnic.Later_forest.26": "The original incident occurred during my adventuring days with my ex-wife.${{e3}}#$b#It was one of the rare occasions where we'd agreed on a course of action...${{e3}}#$b#...Even if somewhat reluctantly.${{e2}}",
"Date.Picnic.Later_forest.27": "I do not know what triggered the initial expansion of the void domain.${{e3}}#$b#From the sparse details we were given, it was likely the consequence of the intercrossing of iridium and void energies in an unexpected way.${{e3}}#$b#It had managed to cause some sort of mass curse on an entire city, turning what was once a bustling transport hub into a den of undead and other similar monsters.${{e3}}#$b#The concentration of void energies only served to draw in more such creatures from deep underground.${{e2}}#$b#We were recruited to help deal with the situation as two of the most offensively focused practitioners active at the time.${{e3}}#$b#...But not even we could deal with monsters numbering in the hundreds of thousands...${{e3}}#$b#Not when they still had some fleeting semblances of humanity left...${{e29}}",
"Date.Picnic.Later_forest.28": "You are aware of what occurs to the fallen of Galdora.${{e3}}#$b#It was no different here.${{e3}}#$b#With each loss, the enemy forces grew.${{e3}}#$b#We did not want to risk another exclusionary zone, not that close to several large settlements and a spiritually significant place like the valley, at least.${{e3}}#$b#Thus, all of us magicians who'd been gathered by the Ministry made a drastic decision:${{e3}}#$b#Sink the entire city and everything tainted by the void deep into the sands themselves.${{e3}}",
"Date.Picnic.Later_forest.29": "Void energies originate from deep within the earth itself.${{e3}}#$b#Despite its damaging nature to us, it too is a force of nature and key to maintaining balance.${{e3}}#$b#Thus, the best solution was to return it where it should lie before whatever incident caused it to surface.${{e3}}#$b#The iridium mine that had played a large part in the original disaster would act as the ideal focal anchoring point for the spell.${{e3}}#$b#It would also serve as a way to disperse the monster hoard somewhat, making it far more practical to slowly eliminate them in small groups, floor by floor if anyone were determined enough to do so.${{e3}}#$b#Hopefully, by the time they reached the buried city far below, the numbers would have significantly thinned out by then.${{e3}}",
"Date.Picnic.Later_forest.30": "How did I get referenced on the plaques?#$b#My specialization as a planes Wizard made me ideal for handling the vast amounts of mana required for such a complex spell.${{e3}}#$b#I was already extremely well versed in large area-of-effect magic from my experience in the war, so it made most sense for me to complete the final casting.${{e3}}#$b#If I had to offer a hypothesis, that role I played may have made me out to be the one to decide their fate in the undead's eyes.${{e3}}#$b#I do not mind being accredited such a sin, my love.${{e9}}#$b#After all, I was one who agreed on the premise of the greater good even if I was uncomfortable with prospect.${{e3}}#$b#In a sense, it is rather poetic that you became the hero they sought to finally set their souls free.${{e1}}#$b#Many have taken the thankless task over the years in both a sense of justice and for the rich iridium deposits still existing within that mine...${{e3}}#$b#But unlike them, your prowess in fighting monsters is near unmatched.${{e9}}#$b#I'm sure you made short work of many of their twisted forms.${{e3}}",
"Date.Picnic.Later_forest.31": "As for how I became responsible for the seals despite the Calico desert officially falling under Castle Village...${{e3}}#$b#It is simply more convenient for the person who cast the seal to inspect it.${{e1}}#$b#Not to mention, I would not need to fight against the void energies to actually make a trip to skull cavern compared to anyone from Castle Village.${{e9}}",
"Date.Picnic.Later_forest.32": "Well, my love?${{e9}}#$b#How do you feel after learning of another of my heaviest sins?${{e3}}",
"Date.Picnic.Later_forest.33": "...You do not consider literally sinking an entire city and its people below the sands a sin?${{e3}}",
"Date.Picnic.Later_forest.34": "Yes, you are correct. That is a rather disingenuous way of wording the events. ${{e0}}#$b#...The majority of my guilt lies within how we ultimately chose to handle what occurred with what was convenient for us above all else.${{e2}}#$b#What I did to those people was subject them to an endless existence of torment, @.${{e5}}#$b#You saw those plaques.${{e2}}#$b#They have not lost themselves entirely.${{e2}}#$b#Yet, we treated them like mindless monsters, extending their suffering by pushing the true final solution to later generations.${{e5}}#$b#What would you call that but a sin?${{e2}}",
"Date.Picnic.Later_forest.35": "I did not mean to sadden you, my love.${{e2}}#$b#It is my hope that by sharing such events you are able to view the world and its components within the context of the past.${{e3}}#$b#If you are able to gain something approaching insight from these stories then they are worth telling.${{e1}}",

"MondayGos_Camilla_12": "You know, I was expecting some occult obsessed weirdo when Razzy told me he formed 'relations' with a mortal.$1#$b#Kind of wishing I'd been the one living in the valley now.$5#$e#On second thought I'd have to watch Razzy brood for who knows how long so maybe not.$2",
"MondayGos_Camilla_13": "Hi, dear! You're looking cute as usual. $5 #$b#Let me know when you get bored of that dusty old fossil over there and want to have some fun.$4#$e#Gah!$7#$b# That was a joke! Stop lecturing me telepathically!$3",
"MondayGos_Camilla_14": "Back again for more, dear?$1#$b#Do you like hearing the gossip on Razzy that much or do you just like me? $6",
"MondayGos_Camilla_15": "Hello, dear.#$b#Did you know that your dear husband over there has never taken apprentices in the thousand years he's been around until recently?#$b#I wonder what could have changed. $5 ",
"MondayGos_Camilla_16": "Hello, cutie.#$b#I'm a little curious. Did Razzy start off by talking vague riddles at you too?#$e#Wow, he even went on depressing tangents about his ex-wife while you were still just friends?$7#$b#You must be a saint, @.$2#$b# It's a miracle the dense old fossil even has friends let alone you.$3",
"MondayGos_Camilla_17": "Hello, @. I'm looking forward to having such a cute little friend once you officially join the Order.$1#$b#It'd definitely spice up these boring mage meetings Razzy insists on.$3",
"MondayGos_Camilla_18": "I was pretty surprised when Razzy suggested we meet so often.#$b#He's become a lot more active as of late.#$b#I wonder why. $5",
"MondayGos_Camilla_19": "The anxiety on Razzy's face whenever I put this barrier up so we can talk, it's absolutely delicious.$5#$b# I can picture what's exactly going through his head. #$b#'Is Camilla seducing @ right in front me!?'#$b# 'What if @ likes Camilla better because she's not dusty and boring!?'#$b#Absolutely hilarious.#$e#I swear he has no awareness at all.#$b#What? Unlike him, I'm not blind. I've seen how you look at each other.$6#$b#Even I feel like telling you two to get a room sometimes!$8 #$e#Don't tell on me, @. Let me keep enjoying that fuming expression of his.$5 #$e#Then again, I doubt it would change much, insecure fool.$2 ",
"MondayGos_Camilla_20": "I ramble about Razzy a lot, but what about you, @? Are you happy? #$e# Good to hear Razzy's doing his job properly.$1#$e#I didn't know if he really had it in him to satisfy someone so young and...vigorous.$1",
"MondayGos_Camilla_21": "Razzy once took over for my master briefly while she was off on Ministry errands during my apprentice days.#$b#He's very patient and compulsively explains everything if you prod him a little.$1#$b#I'm still open for tutoring, though if you'd prefer something more practical...and fire-related. $5#$e#I guess it would be weird if he wasn't patient, having lived for a thousand years and all.",
"MondayGos_Camilla_22": "Razzy at his core is a pretty forgiving person.#$b#Why do you think he keeps inviting me for chats when all I do is tease him for hours on end?$5",
"MondayGos_Camilla_23": "I swear if I get another lecture from that old fossil, I'm going to actually blow something up.$3#$b#How the heck do you stand living with him?$3",
"MondayGos_Camilla_24": "Standing here while you two talk is pretty suffocating.$2#$b#I feel like I'm drowning in...$2#$b# 'Energies'? Love??$3#$b#I just know the old fossil is lying it on real thick. It's a miracle you can stand this corniness. $3",
"MondayGos_Camilla_25": "I knew Razzy was the overprotective type, but not to this level.#$b#Make sure to have time to yourself, @.$1#$e#My door's always open. $5#$b#Gah!$7#$b#A joke! It was a joke!$3#$b#Calm down you dusty old fossil!$3",
"MondayGos_Camilla_26": "I hope you're having fun during your studies, @.#$b#If Razzy's lessons get too dry, I'm sure I can help you out.$5",
"MondayGos_Camilla_27": " You know, I never would have expected a person like you to have the taste in men you do.$1#$b#If it were me, I definitely would have picked the dashing adventurer combat wizard over the dusty recluse who sits in his tower all day surrounded by thousands of books.#$b#Or maybe a beautiful witch, hmm?$4#$e#Jokes aside, Razzy is one of those investment types.#$b#You know, the sort of person who gives back what you put in.$1#$b#From what I've seen of you two, you're practically made for each other in that regard.$5",
"MondayGos_Camilla_28": "How much has Razzy been sharing about our research?#$b#Not a lot I'm guessing.$1#$b#Let's just say he has some pretty crazy ideas from time to time.$3#$b#I'd expect nothing less from someone who'd survived the Elemental Wars.",
"MondayGos_Camilla_29": "Razzy always tries to act like he's cool and collected, but we all know he's a hot mess inside and out to put it mildly.$1#$b#I have to admit, he's been a lot better since you two got married.#$b#At least now I'm sure he won't be munching on moss any time soon!$5 ",
"MondayGos_Camilla_30": "You know, I'm not the only one who's taken an interest in you, @.$5#$b#You're practically the talk of the town at Ministry HQ.#$b#Even if your potential wasn't that great, it's not every day a founding members of the Ministry gets married, let alone Razzy.$5#$b#That stuff with his ex-wife? It was real bad based on what I heard.$2#$b#She sounded like a bit of a megalomaniac though. I doubt you'd try anything nearly as stupid.$5",
"MondayGos_Camilla_31": "There are a lot of rumours and gossip about Razzy if you care enough to dig for them.#$b#Not many mages make it to the big four digits, after all.#$b#I doubt anyone who does is entirely sane if I'm being honest.$2#$b#Razzy's no different even if he does a great job at hiding it.$1",
"MondayGos_Camilla_32": "Are you having fun in your day-to-day, @?#$b#Razzy's approach to things tends to lean on the dry and proper side, but the impression you give me is more Spontaneous, if you know what I mean.$5#$b#Let me know if you want to ditch the dusty fossil and have some fun with your big sister Camilla.$5#$b#It'll be our little personal adventure.$4#$b#Gah!$7#$b#What, I can't even invite @ on outings now!?$3#$b#Damn possessive old fossil!$3",
"MondayGos_Camilla_33": "How are you doing, @? Is Razzy making you suffer with his 'grandpa' moments?#$b#I know I got my share of them over the years.$2#$e#What is it with him and jumping into hour's long lectures without being asked?$3#$b#Would it kill the fossil to reduce his explanation to twenty words or less!?$3#$b#Who needs to hear him ramble about plants when all you asked was how to cast an insect warding spell!?$3#$b#I'd probably go crazy within a month if I had your life, @.",
"MondayGos_Camilla_34": "Interested in more Razzy gossip?$1#$b#To tell you the truth, most of the rumours are pretty old.#$b#I don't know about adventuring war hero Razzy, but current Razzy's the type who mostly keeps to himself until someone needs him for something and guilts their way into having him take responsibility.$1#$b#Quite the busybody, that old fossil.#$b#...But, I'm sure you're intimately aware of that by now.$5",
"MondayGos_Camilla_35": "It's kind of late to ask, but Razzy has mentioned all the doctrine stuff to you, right?#$b#I heard they made him your guarantor for the next century. #$e#Enjoy that 100 years, @.$5#$b#You're going to have to memorize and follow a bunch of arbitrary rules afterwards.$3#$b#The Ministry does good work a majority of the time, but the bureaucracy is headache inducing.$3",
"MondayGos_Camilla_36": "Razzy is actually one of the founding members of the Ministry of Magic.#$b#I heard he declined a leadership role way back, but that didn't stop the Ministry from passing him admin work all the same.#$e#I bet he's regretting declining it now. Would have made getting you a cushy position reeaal easy.$5#$e#Who am I kidding? That old fossil has way too much 'integrity' to abuse his position even if he had it.$3#$b#Damn fool never does what's best for himself.$3#$b#I'm always amazed he's lived this long without being conned into something.$3",
"MondayGos_HasChild1_HasBioChild_Camilla_1": "I would have never believed you and Razzy could actually have a kid together until I saw that cute little face through the scrying spell.$7#$b#Guess he's treating you better than expected, @.$5",
"MondayGos_HasChild1_HasAdoptChild_Camilla_1": "I heard you guys adopted a baby from the Ministry?$1#$b#Razzy must really be committed long term if he's going that far.",
"MondayGos_HasChild1_Camilla_2": "Hey, do you think I could come visit the house to take a look at--$1#$b#Ugh, never mind. I can feel Razzy's death glare now.$3",
"MondayGos_HasChild1_Camilla_3": "I never thought I would live to see the day Razzy actually becomes a father.$1#$b#He tries to pretend like it's a secret, but anyone with eyes would notice how much he romanticized the concept.#$e#I'm guessing reality hit him pretty hard?$5",
"MondayGos_HasChild1_Camilla_4": "Wow, Razzy must be desperate.$1#$b#He even asked *me* for child care advice.$1",
"MondayGos_HasChild2_Camilla_1": "I can't wait till your children are old enough to become apprentices. $6#$b#Can you imagine all the teasing potential?$5",
"MondayGos_HasChild2_Camilla_2": "I knew teasing him about you was fun, but the sheer panic on his face when he has to watch the kids alone?$1#$b#Priceless.$6#$e#How do I know?#$b#Let's just say Razzy's been a little sloppy with the dispelling charms lately because of children troubles.",
"MondayGos_HasChild2_HasBioChild_Camilla_3": "You're pretty new at this so you probably haven't noticed, but you and Razzy's offspring have monstrous magical potential.#$b#I could tell the moment I set foot in the valley.$1#$e#Let me take one as my apprentice, alright? Consider it a favour for your older sister.$5#$e#Then again, Razzy would probably never let me hear the end of it so maybe not. $3",
"MondayGos_HasChild2_HasAdoptChild_Camilla_3": "I heard someone in the Ministry back end pulled some strings for you and Razzy on the kid front?#$b#They picked a few good seedlings too.$1#$b#Guess someone's looking out for you and the fossil, huh?$5",
"MondayGos_HasChild2_HasBioChild_Camilla_4": "I would have never believed you and Razzy could actually have multiple kids together until I saw those cute little faces through the scrying spell.$7#$b#Guess he's treating you better than expected, @.$5",
"MondayGos_HasChild2_HasAdoptChild_Camilla_4": "How's the whole 'adopting from the Ministry' thing going so far?#$b#Don't be surprised if someone from child services pops in to check out if everything's going well every once in a while.#$b#They're pretty serious about this sort of thing.$1",
"MondayGos_HasChild2_Camilla_5": "Hey, do you think I could come visit the house to take a look at--$1#$b#Ugh, never mind. I can feel Razzy's death glare now.$3",
"MondayGos_HasChild2_Camilla_6": "It's kind of gratifying watching Razzy actually grow into the whole father role.#$b#I can't imagine how much of a relief it is for you.$5",

"ThursdayGos_Camilla_1": "Hello, dear. Have you come to aid Castle Village?$0#$e#There's more monsters than usual loitering around today...$2",
"ThursdayGos_Camilla_2": "Razzy will actually kill me if I let anything happen to you so stay safe out there, cutie.$1#$e#I'll come out to help if I notice anything. ",
"ThursdayGos_Camilla_3": "Let me know if you want to learn some more exciting magic, @.#$b#I'm sure I could pen you in without Razzy noticing.$5#$e# Gah, maybe not. That's way too many layers of wards to deal with on a Thursday. $3 ",
"ThursdayGos_Camilla_4": "I hope Razzy's not limiting your magic potential just to make sure he can register you as his apprentice. #$b# You'd make a great combat mage. $5",
"ThursdayGos_Camilla_5": "I wonder who's responsible for the sudden influx of void-related research material at Razzy's tower and the sudden decrease of monsters out here?$5#$b#Honestly, you two would be the perfect duo if the dusty old fossil would trust in your skills a bit more.$1",

"Camilla_Paranoid.0": "I heard about what happened, dear.$2#$b#I'll lend Razzy my assistance, of course, so no need to worry your pretty little head.$1#$b#Now, if you can get him to calm down a bit, I would be grateful.$3#$e#I don't need him messaging me every hour to fish for an update.$3",
"Camilla_MemorySpell.0": "Hmm? A memory extraction spell? Where did you hear of that?$1#$e#Razzy said what?!$7#$b#Listen to me, @. You must not let Magnus cast that spell.$2#$b#Not only does it put the person it's cast on at tremendous risk, if something goes wrong the caster will also suffer backlash.$2#$b#Knowing Razzy, he's probably going to take on all the danger himself considering you're the target.$3#$b#He definitely won't admit to anything if I ask so it's probably up to you.$2#$e#Good luck, dear.$2#$e#Yoba help me, that idiot fossil is hopeless.$3#$b#How the hell has he even managed to survive this long???$3",
"Camilla_PostQi.0": "So, you've managed to resolve the situation with Razzy somewhat.#$b#Of course I noticed. He returned all the reports he requested and the eye bags went away.$1#$e#Honestly, I'm impressed.$1#$b#I didn't think anyone would be able to talk the crazy fossil back to sanity.$3#$b#For a moment there I thought I may actually have to use force on the poor bastard for his own good.$2#$b#Retired or not, I would rather not have to fight Razzy at half power, let alone potentially full.$2#$e#You can't underestimate those that survived the Elemental Wars.#$b#They always have something they're holding back for emergencies.",

Taking a break from your date with old man Razzy to climb some cliffs and speak to your big sister Camilla?$4#$b#I'm flattered.$1#$b#You better go back soon, though.$0#$b#I think the ancient fossil's 2 lengthy conversations away from banishing me for stealing his cutie away, haha!$1",
